The herbalist Lesale once attempted to explore the jungles, but was stung by a poisonous reptile, which transformed him into the  Venomancer.",
      "Bioluminescent vines are common in the Acid Jungles, and produce a sort of caustic sap which drip from its leaves. Epiphytes can be found on and around trees. Armored orchids also grow in the jungle, and produce nectar useful to apothecaries. The many plants of the Acid Jungle provide a wealth of pharmaceutical potential, and it is this reason that led Lesale to enter the jungles in the first place.",
      "The use of venom has evolved in many creatures of the Acid Jungle. One such creature, a reptile disguised as an epiphyte, stung Lesale and began his transformation into the Venomancer. Spitterpedes inhabit the jungle, hunting prey with projectile venom. The Splattering Forcipule, a distant relative of the Spitterpedes, anchors itself in damp crevices and between roots, killing and melting prey by spitting venom, then absorbing the nutrients from the corpse through their subterranean root-tendrils. The Fradjan Moth also inhabits the jungle, forming cocoons inside its many orchid species.",
      "Some organisms in the jungle are known to burrow to avoid predators.",
      "Seeking new herbal essences, the herbalist Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj to investigate the plants of the Acid Jungle. After being stung by a poisonous reptile, he quickly concocted an antidote from the nectar of an armored orchid, and the venom of the reptile itself. This antidote did not cure him, but instead, sent him into a seventeen year long coma. The combination of venom and nectar began to transform his flesh. He was reborn as the Venomancer, a snake-like being with extremely potent toxins. How much of his human mind remains is uncertain."

To enter Claszureme, one must have a strong understanding of the teachings of Clasz. What relation, if any, Claszureme has to the Seven Planes is unknown. The space between Claszureme and other realms is incredibly cold. To fully understand the mysteries of Claszureme, one must dedicate oneself to its \"dimensional defense\". What this entails precisely is unknown.",

      "Nezzureme, an unknown entity, is likely related to Claszureme.",
      "Clasz rules over Claszureme. The Dhreg Cult is likely based somewhere in Claszureme, and preaches from the many chapels located within the realm.",
      "Darkterror hails from Claszureme, and is able to pass through the realm by tearing a hole in time. He is also able to open a rift to Claszureme, trapping and pausing time for all things within a dimensional bubble. Beings traveling to the normal realm from Claszureme often arrive in uncertain timelines, and require guidance to avoid being lost in time. Puck has been to Claszureme, where he learned that Darkterror is not wanted in the realm, and many of its inhabitants are glad to see him depart to the mortal realm.",
      "According to Darkterror, unknown forces in Claszureme will visit unpleasant consequences upon him if he fails to attain victory in the mortal dimension. When he is defeated, he returns to Claszureme. Darkterror also appears to reference a number of gods, but no further detail is given."

      "Following this revelation, Leshrac has professed himself as the guardian of this plane's Impurities and an evil agent for nature.",
      "Through the Chronoptic Crystals, Leshrac delved into the unexplored depths of creation and learned that the truth of nature is torment, suffering, and decay.\nAs such, he believes that everyone is actually tormented like he is, but he laments that they are utterly unaware of their tormented existence unlike him.\nThus, he forces everyone to see the truth like he did by sending them here, returning their form to where it came to return to and become one with the Impurities.",
      "As such, he believes that everyone is actually tormented like he is, but he laments that they are utterly unaware of their tormented existence unlike him.",
      "Thus, he forces everyone to see the truth like he did by sending them here, returning their form to where it came to return to and become one with the Impurities.",
      "Leshrac's discovery of this world and its evil truth are the basis of his evil personality and nihilism, rejecting those who believe the cosmos will reward good.",
      "The heart of nature's lore may have been inspired by the concept of the world being created from a state of chaos, common in creation myths that depict this world as being made from disorder. Between these stories and myths, chaos may be depicted as a formless heap of mass or pure nothingness, or even a being who identifies as either depictions.",
      "At the depths of our natural world is the very heart of nature itself (also referred to as nature's blasted core, heart of all creation, heart of existence, core of all existence, fundament of nature, core of the universe, etc.), a plane of existence in the world of Dota 2.",
      "Although nature is very much real, what we know is hardly the truth of the cosmos. The reality of reality is that there is a central hinterland deep within the totality of creation, a world that has torment, suffering, and decay as its essentials. This is the heart of nature. Due to its hidden nature, it can be seen thru the haunted Chronoptic Crystals, and those who do so will find a revelation so horrifying and hideous that it alters them irreparably on every level of their being. As such, the heart of nature is lurid and vile.",
      "Besides the core of Nature being a world of torment and decay, it is said by Leshrac to be a blasted world, meaning that it's a nature destroyed and damaged. Despite its evilness, it's substantial to the existence of this universe, since it is called the \u201ccore of the universe\u201d or the \u201cfundament of nature\u201d to Enigma, the latter name implying that this foul plane is the very foundation of all creation which supports its existence\u2014a starting point for creation from where all things in nature are formed from.",
      "According to Leshrac, the physical form generally comes from this plane of existence, which may explain why it is called the heart of nature. If every being's form originates from this blasted plane, then all who have their bodies provided to them from this plane is undergoing an existence of suffering that they have yet to learn until they realize it by seeing this evil truth of nature for themselves, since their corporeal body's origin is a world made of tormented elements.",
      "Akin to the natural world's elements, the Impurities are the elements that form the heart of all creation. As impure elements, the whole that they compose mirrors their properties, thus it's a plane of blight and torment. There are 4 Impurities corresponding with the elements or states of matter: sinister energy, tainted water, evil wind, and brittle earth.",
      "Judging by these impure elements of nature, the heart of nature is also hostile, polluted, and broken down to the point of fragility, truly making this plane a realm of utter chaos.",
      "A malfunction with the reality warping Continuum Device opened the paths to many realms and dimensions in the Continuum Vault, including the Weald of Torment, which is implied to be in the heart of nature. The nihilist Ash the Defiler lives in this forest.",
      "Interestingly, the place chosen for Enigma to receive random item drops is the \"fundament of nature\" or the \"core of the universe\" where things he calls \u201ctreasures\u201d spring from.",
      "Perhaps this world was chosen as his source of random drops because it is a chaotic plane, further adding that the heart of nature is also chaotic because of its randomness, besides its impurity and desolation. This also adds the fact that this evil heart of nature does not just create the form itself, but just about anything that Enigma considers a worthy treasure. As such, its power of creation from chaos means that this place isn't just the source of the form, but also the source of creation itself, at least on a material level.",
      "Speaking of creation from chaos, this is similar to creation from nothingness. This may bridge the gap between this realm and everything related to it with nothingness since a state of chaos is closer to annihilation or nothingness than a state of order, as the Chaos Knight himself can attest.",
      "The core of reality being the source of creation competes in validity with the various creation stories found in Dota 2, such as existence being created from the Elder Titan's great flaw, all of existence being born from the sundering of the Wailing One, the essential threads that compose reality being woven from the Loom, etc.",
      "Judging by the kinds of people who know or are related with the place, the heart of reality is known to and meant for nihilists only. After all, mere knowledge of this plane is enough to turn anyone into a pessimistic nihilist, such as Leshrac.",
      "It is interesting to notice that there seems to be no intelligences native to this plane. The only intelligences here are those that are non-native lifeforms, but rather, visitors like Leshrac (although he, and perhaps all of creation, technically belongs here). Maybe the lack of native sapient beings has something to do with the plane having witless elements, with \"witless\" possibly meaning that they lack a mind. If there were any native intelligences here, then Leshrac would not have called this place a cloister. But this isn't the case, implying that he's the only creature here.",
      "Once a great philosopher,  Leshrac sought the meaning of existence via plumbing the depths of reality with the Chronoptic Crystals. Peering through the haunted Crystals, Leshrac alone saw the horrifying truth of nature at its very core that irreparably warped him into the foul being that he is today, at one with the agonizing unnature that he discovered.",
      "Ash the Defiler lives in the Weald of Torment, accessible in the Continuum Vault. His place's name implies that it's in the heart of nature. It's unknown if he coexists with Leshrac.",
      "Solely based on the plants that grow on Leshrac's body\u2014which is completely at one with this realm and thus it's a reflection of what may grow in there\u2014the heart of nature seems to have its own plant life, just like the natural plane that it supports.",
      "Appearing as a growth on Leshrac's body when he drank the tainted waters, there are branches or roots that can channel great but unknown power.",
      "Ridged, climbing vines that are said to be a \u201ctwisted sort of wisdom\u201d grow here, feeding and thriving off of their host's anguish, black thoughts, and foul deeds.",
      "Thorny and stone-hard fungi that resemble mushroom caps grow here. They are also said to be unnatural, maybe because they grew beyond their homeworld on Leshrac's body or the world they're from is unnatural. As one of the growths on his form, they may be sustained by the tainted waters that also gave him his other growths, like his arm's branches.",
      "When  Enigma receives a \u201ctreasure\u201d of great worth, he will mention its source: a place he calls the \u201cfundament of nature\u201d and the \u201ccore of the universe.\u201d These two names might be referring to a single place and both names are synonymous with the heart of nature, which means that he may be referring to this said plane of existence. This makes him one of the few entities to know about the evil truth of nature. Him knowing this place may also explain why he's nihilistic and pessimistic like Leshrac and Ash. Upon acquiring an  Arcane rune, Enigma reuses the second voice line, implying that these runes come from the core of the universe for some reason."

The two forces, complete opposites in every way, could find no compromise between each other. Zet, another fragment of the primordial mind, grew tired of their strife and fused his siblings into a single sphere. He flung them into space to drift for eternity. Eventually, this sphere was captured in the orbit of a still cooling world, Earth, shining over it as the races came into being. Because of its power, the Mad Moon glowed brightly over the Earth, competing even with the brightness of the sun.",
      "But the forces inside still fought, and the Mad Moon began to show imperfections. It was then that Valora, the Dawnbreaker crashed into the moon whilst she was in her dormant state, she apologizes to Zet for her transgressions and vows to destroy both ancients. Zet's power waned, small weaknesses expanded, and eventually the sphere broke apart, raining down material onto the World. The remains of the Mad Moon settled as Radiant Ore and Direstone, pure materials of the two intelligences. The World fell into temporary chaos, though some took advantage of the situation. Abzidian, the Demon Smith, used this time to forge Demon Edge from the raw materials that fell.",
      "After the Mad Moon was destroyed, the Radiant Ore and Direstone began to emit pure energy that corrupted the races. They became dependent on it and built civilizations around the material, while the rock provided them with energy, Mana, and life. The Radiant Ore gave off the emission of bright color and charm to the area around it, while the Direstone made the earth appear poisonous and decayed. Neither was neutral in its actions. The energies they gave off were incompatible, and interfered with each other. Eventually, the followers of each of the forces became aware of this, and sought to destroy the opposite stone. This struggle is what started the endless battle, as seen in the game."

Its darkness emits a blinding glow that illuminates the blackest reaches of the light that permeates the realm. Anything that encumbers in the Nothl Realm will manifest as a source of strength on the material plane. Because of its paradoxical elements and inherent dangers, a spiritual journey to this realm can be very harrowing and dangerous. There is a chance that its visitants may never return their spirit to their home world, and some of its visitants may return mad or return with powers sourced from the realm itself.",

If they complete the dark initiation safely, they will become Shadow Priests, vectors of the Nothl's power into the earthly plane.",
      "Seasoned acolytes of the Order can perform the  Shallow Grave rite, preventing the death of its recipient no matter how close they are to their death. The ritual works by preserving the faintest spark of life that remains in a dying person's heart to restart it. It seems that the darkness of the Nothl is behind the spell's power.",
      "The  Shadow Wave is the most common ritual among the ranks of the Shadow Priests, thanks to its effectiveness which stems from its simplicity. Dazzle's version of this ritual casts a healing light that is actually a hidden sinister evil.",

Unique to Dazzle because of his ethereal journey to the Nothl, the user can mend together the power of both light and dark to create shifting waves of enchantments that can benefit and weaken friend and foe respectively.",

These holy garments are revered for their hallowed creators and catalysts of heightened Nothlic power.",

His time spent in the Nothl Realm has granted him a strong connection to that world, blessing him with the power to wield its inverted elements.

A scroll-shaped map and a M\u00f6bius strip map was considered, which the viewer could rotate and zoom in on to find out the names of different places related to each other in unexpected ways. He added that these maps can be rotated and stretched, causing the topography to change.",
      "But this idea was dropped in favor of the 2D map found in Source 1 because there were no people or time to work on such a complex idea. An additional problem was figuring out the coordinates where these regions would be placed in these complex maps. Although Laidlaw found the final one disappointing, he did find it easier to understand."

While flying, they can propel themselves through the air with blasts of wind to increase their already impressive speed. They also generate gusts of wind that usually signal their presence when they fly through enclosed areas, such as a cave.",
      "A distinct feature of Aethrak and his fellow air dragons are their eaglelike body parts. They have five sharp talons at the ends of their feet, wide wings that fold when diving (which helps lessen aerodynamic drag), and streamlined spikes around their body that help them fly through the air at high speeds. The wyrmlings seem to have spikes on their snouts that resemble beaks, but it starts to disappear when they grow into older eldwurms.",
      "All air dragons are deadly carnivores. While hunting, they fly at altitudes high enough to reach the clouds while still being able to see their prey from long distances. They hunt their prey by movement, meaning that they are more likely to pursue prey that shows any signs of movement rather than those that stay still.",
      "Once they catch sight of a potential meal, they begin their descent by diving headfirst and folding their wings. In the moment that their prey are within the grasp of their talons, they will unfold their wings and reach out their talons to carry the unlucky victim away for consumption. Even if they fail to secure their prey in this manner, they are quite persistent hunters. They will continue pursuing them while flying in low altitudes (even inside dense forests) to make sure that they can capture them again.",
      "Like all Eldwurms, Aethrak is immortal in a sense that he can reincarnate as long as there is a suitable host body for his soul to take up residence. Upon death, he finds the next oldest dragon of his type (which is the air dragons in his case) before filling their soulless body with his own soul. The vessels he possesses are not immortal themselves, so they all die naturally like any living creature, but it is said that they have long lifespans and grow stronger in both physical strength and their respective elemental powers as they mature and age rather than wither into weaker dragons."

It is from his species that Kaden's Blade was forged with which means they can manipulate their own gravity to exponentially increase their own mass, allowing them to strike harder with their massive tails and other limbs. The portal scrolls used by the Dragon Knights (such as Bram) are also made from void dragon remains. This could imply that void dragons can also manipulate space to teleport themselves over a considerable distance.",
      "Like all Eldwurms, Byssrak is immortal in a sense that he can reincarnate as long as there is a suitable host body for his soul to take up residence. Upon death, he finds the next oldest dragon of his type (which is the void dragons in his case) before filling their soulless body with his own soul. The vessels he possesses are not immortal themselves, so they all die naturally like any living creature, but it is said that they have long lifespans and grow stronger in both physical strength and their respective elemental powers as they mature and age rather than wither into weaker dragons."

      "The Primordial Consciousness (also known as Primordial Mind, Primordial Origin, or simply the Primordial) is the first mind to exist in the lore of Dota 2, long before creation and existence itself.",
      "It is said to be the progenitor of all creation, at least according to one of its greater fragments. When the universe was created, it was split into many fragments. Three of its greater fragments were known as Radinthul, Diruulth, and Zet. When the Primordial Mind was shattered into Diruulth, Radinthul, and Zet, they existed and fought in a world before the current world. It is unknown what this world is called. Because they all share the same progenitor, Zet sometimes refers to its sibs as its other selves, as if they were one and the same being.",
      "The two greater fragments of the Primordial Mind (now known as the Ancients) exist in the Nemesis Stones that once made up the Mad Moon before it was destroyed by the warring Ancients. On the other hand, the power that Zet used to imprison them both was trapped in a stone known as Nemestice, which also dwells in the same moonstuff that once formed the Mad Moon.",
      "An aspect of the Primordial named Zet knows the mystery behind the origins of the Runes of Power. His testament to this knowledge is his ability to create these runes out of thin air.",
      "The lore about the Wailing One sounds very similar to the lore surrounding the entity known as Zet. Although both stories have their differences, they both mention a primordial mind that predated all of existence and was subsequently shattered to witness all of creation. Both stories even mention a great schism."

      "Little is known about the deathly Reaper besides its appearance and its abode. In Dota 2, this foul Reaper is depicted as a figure whose disembodied form is cloaked by a sable shroud. This psychopomp always carries a massive scythe, most certainly used to harvest the souls of those who have departed from life. In Artifact, the Reaper is still depicted in the Book of the Dead as a dark hooded figure wielding a large scythe, but it appears the Reaper also has a pair of red eyes and a pair of wings that resemble that of an angel's feathered fins.",
      "Like a hungry predator, the Reaper in Dota 2 is said to lurk beyond the veil of death for souls to harvest with its scythe, suggesting that it dwells in the Underscape.",
      "But in Artifact, this Reaper is depicted in a skyscape similar to common interpretations of Heaven with the clouds and the sun's rays shining through them. This seems to elicit the idea that the Reaper must be an angel of some sorts.",
      "The amount of death  Necrophos has caused with his power has garnered him a following from the Reaper. Thus he can summon the psychopomp itself to cull the living.",
      "Nobody in Dota 2's lore likes  Leshrac. Even he knows that Death itself reviles him.",
      "Within the Red Mist was its Reaper, who in truth was  Axe, a devil of a man who slew cowards and deserters. Perhaps the Red Mist Reaper was inspired by the psychopomp itself.",
      "In  Pudge's biography, it is said that those who don't fear the Reaper do have Pudge to be afraid of, which Pudge himself asserts."

He then offers the Shopkeeper's Gem, and says that they will need it to \"see\" him.",

The myth explains that the Wailing One was once a whole entity until it conceived a single paradoxical thought. The Wailing One could not think this thought and become one being and thus it was rent asunder, its many fragments forming the multiplanar universe of today.",
      "Today, the various ranks of the ancient Order of the Oyo\u2014ranging from its Aesthetes to its Brewmasters\u2014strive to find the answer to the one paradoxical thought that the Wailing One could not answer. The one thought that would reunite the material and spiritual planes back to what it was in the beginning.",
      "The lore about the Wailing One sounds very similar to the lore surrounding the entity known as  Arc Warden and its origin, the one Primordial Consciousness. Although both stories have their differences, they both mention a primordial mind that predated all of existence and was subsequently shattered to witness all of creation.",
      "Such speculation is supported even further when the Wailing Mountains' wheel books that usually sing of the great rift in all of existence sing a new song of conflict that is implied to portend the battle of the Ancients, who also sprang from an ancient consciousness."

Most dragons make use of the elements or forces of nature, but these dragons have powers that would consider them as eldritch creatures. Their ability to phase out of reality, redirect attacks around them, and teleport short distances (via shifting between the planes) makes it difficult to land a hit on them, let alone touching these dragons. Kaden sought out these dragons for their abilities, imbuing his armor with the powers of a chaos dragon.",

Upon death, he finds the next oldest dragon of his type (which is the chaos dragons in his case) before filling their soulless body with his own soul. The vessels he possesses are not immortal themselves, so they all die naturally like any living creature, but it is said that they have long lifespans and grow stronger in both physical strength and their respective elemental powers as they mature and age rather than wither into weaker dragons.",

      "Angels are a group of luminous and heavenly beings in the lore of Dota 2.",
      "Some angels like Lucifer before his fall dwell in a heavenly place known only as the \u201cthe realm behind the light\u201d, \u201cthe light\u201d, or \u201cParadise\u201d which is Dota 2's version of Heaven.",
      "One angel known as the Omniscience dwells in the earth's deepest core as a result of it allegedly creating the mineral shell around it that became the planet of Dota 2.",
      "Like most things in Dota 2's lore's soft worldbuilding, angels are very loosely defined beings. But based on the few mentions of them in the lore, it may be said that they are holy beings of light who bear wings that keep them bound to the light and prevent them from falling away.",
      "Defiance to an unknown entity or covenant is a sin among the Angels, which is punishable by exile. The angel's name is tolled from the forged steel bell of Vashundol, forecasting their punishment via branding their wings with fire until they are reduced to stumps, releasing the wingless angel from the realm behind the light and banishing them forever.",
      "The lore of the  Keeper of the Light, the Light Brigade, Light's Keep, and the Light itself whence Ezalor rides from might be connected to the lore surrounding the angels.",
      "First of all, the many meanings of Lucifer's name are related to light, with meanings like \"light bringer\" or \"morning star\" being a few examples. So he was once holy and luminous.",
      "The Light Brigade is implied to be the Light's army, whereas Light's Keep is an aptly named place where the Light is presumably kept. Perhaps connections can be drawn to the angelic army that Lucifer once led before his fall as a favored general and the realm he was exiled from to the luminous brigade and keep respectively.",
      "What truly connects this Brigade and this Keep with Lucifer's implied army and the place behind the light is the one similarity he has with Ezalor: a rebellious temperament. Lucifer defied his mysterious father by refusing to kneel just as the headstrong Ezalor escaped the Fundamental Plane in defiance of the \u201cfirst covenant\u201d that he still defies today.",
      "It's possible that Lucifer inherited Ezalor's rebellious nature as his descendant at the very least, which means that the latter once led the angels and their general Lucifer as well. Hence Lucifer and the angels may also serve the same light that the Keeper himself keeps safe.",
      "Doom was once a favored angel general from the realm behind the light, until he fell from grace for his defiance and was stripped of his wings, banishing him from Paradise.",
      "The Omniscience is a  Guardian Angel of purity and light. It has wings that it casts upon those who implore its protection, delivering its faithful and their allies from harm.",

      "Dawnbreaker is very impressed by the unusual design of Doom's wings, even though very little remains of it.",

      "Centaurs are a race of four-legged beings. Beings like  Leshrac or  Magnus are similar to centaurs in appearance, but are not considered centaurs.",
      "The centaurs appear to be a widely distributed species. Some live in the lands of Druud while some live in the landmass where Roseleaf and Stonehall can be located. Other centaurs seem to live near or within the forest territories of the Ancients.",
      "The centaurs do not differ much from the centaurs of fantasy and mythology works, but they do have a few distinct features. Because of this, one centaur may not look like the other centaur.",
      "Their lower torso, which is that of a horse, have varying builds that differ from each individual. Some have lean bodies while others have stocky bodies. Some centaurs have bodies that are fully colored in light beige or blue skin. Some centaurs may have light beige skin for their upper torso and a dark brown color for their lower torso. The stronger centaurs have hides that are thick enough to deflect attacks. Centaurs may grow feathering, the long hair that can be seen on the lower legs of some horse breeds.",
      "Their upper torsos embody a few humanoid features. They may also grow hair (or facial hair for the males) in different colors, usually black or white. Some centaurs may grow a pair of horns that can either be curled or straight in appearance, possibly growing longer when they age. They have short pointy ears and small tusks protruding from their lower jaw. While some centaurs mostly have humanoid faces with the aforementioned features it is possible to see some centaurs have short black noses (like the one seen on dogs) on their face.",
      "The centaurs of Druud are organized into clans, of which only one is known by name, the Marrowfell Hunters. Every year, the Marrowfell clan gallops to Roseleaf to anticipate the migration of the Thunderhides, picking off the strongest members of the herd for trophies. The hunt is a sacred rite to these clansmen, and any attempts to impede it will not be met kindly by the hunters.",
      "The clans were formed at the Clanfounding, presided over by the Elder Greyhoofs.",
      "Centaurs of the clans may find outsider centaurs strange, suggesting a rift in culture.",
      "Despite having no written language, music, or formal religion, centaurs have developed a sophisticated culture around combat, which they believe to be an art, and the highest form of expression. As a proud group of death artists, they must choose their tools of the art wisely. The Centaurs' preferred weapons are axes, maces, halberds, and flails. Some centaurs are skilled archers as well. Indeed, it is believed by many centaurs that the road to glory is paved with dead enemies. Braiding their tails before battle, centaurs seek to have their names remembered through conquest.",
      "The centaurs participate in gladiatorial rites, gathering in particular at the arena of Omexe, and ancient proving ground where warriors from the clans have competed for millennia. The champion of this contest is awarded the Great Belt of Omexe, worn around the torso. Its most recent recipient is Bradwarden, the  Centaur Warrunner, who defeated every challenger until he alone remained standing in the arena. In addition, those victorious in the arena have the right to take the  weapons of any they vanquish.",
      "Prized above all is the Gloried Horn of Druud, an enchanted relic that, when sounded, calls all the centaurs of Druud to battle. It is carefully guarded by the Warrunner and the clan vanguards.",
      "A fierce and free people, the centaurs forbid its members from ever wearing a saddle as it is a sign of servitude to another, although stylish caprisons are permitted, and admired."

      "A warrior of the light, the  Dawnbreaker is the scourge of the night and its creatures. As the last herald of the light, the night creatures prevail when she dies.",
      "Grimstroke is an appreciator of the primordial night creature Balanar, feeling nothing but displeasure in the killing of a creature of great beauty.",
      "Mars has a similar opinion with Grimstroke on the aesthetic of Balanar. He expresses this by planning to mount his head above his mantle.",
      "If the  Void Spirit demands respect from Balanar since Inai is his elder, then perhaps the other night creatures, by extension, have reverence for the void.",

He seems to have some form of control over the likes of Shadow Fiend and Shadow Demon indicating that he is the supreme demon lord among the three.",

He is under the heel of Doom and Shadow Demon, indicating that he is the lowest among the three sovereign demons. Besides being a sovereign demon, he is also one of the three current lords of the Court of Ristul.",
      "Shadow Demon: The very embodiment of the dangers of demonic evocation, Shadow Demon is unique among the sovereign demons in a way that he does not travel to the material plane at his own accord. Instead, he allows himself to be summoned into the material plane by anyone who dares to invoke his presence, before destroying the mind of the summoner and replacing it with his own essence that allows him to control the mindless cultist. In terms of hierarchy, he seems to be in the middle due to being under Doom and having Shadow Fiend under his authority.",

This personal succubus was rune-bound to deliver exquisite pain to the king during his spare moments until he was slain by his subjects for neglecting his duties, free to visit her torments on anyone she deigned to notice. She is a member of the Court of Ristul, but she plans to take her position back from her brother B'Kor.",

Imprisoned in the prison plane Foulfell and sentenced to a dreadful existence of twisted self-contemplation, Terrorblade gazed into the fractal walls of Foulfell and saw his worst self gazing back at him. Instead, he gained control over his inner demon and broke the prison walls, free to terrorize all of creation.",

He fought against a mortal  Clinkz until he was driven back to the gates of sixth hell itself. Maraxiform was slain by Clinkz, but not before incinerating his killer's body and leaving him unable to die from the combination of his perpetual hellfire and an immortality spell that was cast on Clinkz upon their deaths. His head is now being used as a bow by Clinkz.",

The Flayed Twins reclaimed their loyal servant from the demon, but not without sacrifice.",

They are further classified by their age, starting with the youngest, smallest, and weakest dragons that are known as hatchlings, wyrmlings (who are the equivalent of teenage or adolescent dragons), adults, and eldwurms\u2014the oldest, largest, sleepiest, and the most powerful dragons. Regardless of what stage they are in, they are extremely deadly as Bram notes that even hatchlings can tear a grown man's face off.",

All dragons within a single elemental/fundamental species are actually the physical avatars of their respective Eldwurms (note the capital \"E\" that differentiates them from eldwurms who are just old dragons), mere extensions of the Eldwurm's vast embodiment. Because of this, they lack their own soul (hence its lack of consciousness and self-awareness) until an Eldwurm incarnates/reincarnates into these soulless bodies."

      "Kaldr embodies the ice element, but the ice and cold of today is but an echo of what he truly embodies. It's implied that he actually embodies the universe's chilly temperatures that will soon grow colder to usher an event called the Great Equilibrium where all matter will stop in his cold grip.",
      "Besides the material plane where we can observe his icy form and faded power, Kaldr exists outside of time in the cold infinite void that predates creation and will soon outlive it. ",
      "Kaldr's master is Enigma.",
      "Leshrac is unique amongst the elementals. The nature he is aligned with is lurid and vile, and its elements are impure and evil. Unlike other elementals who can control a single element of nature, Leshrac can manipulate all the tainted elements found in his nature. In addition to that, he can manipulate space-time around him.",
      "He is a liminal being that exists half in one plane of existence, half in another. It's possible that he exists on the threshold between the material plane and the plane of existence where he found the evil heart of nature.",
      "He doesn't seem to serve any master, but he often invokes the Impurities as if they are someone/something of importance to him.",
      "Although he did not come from this world, Morphling has since become one with the tides of the planet's oceans.",
      "This elemental exists on the Terrene Plane and the Astral Plane at once, allowing him to deal damage on both levels of existence.",
      "He is said to have an unknown and unnamed master, who was furious with his disappearance and has been looking for him by himself and by proxy of the Children of Light.",
      "Although not evident at first, Barathrum is harmonious with the elements in his own way. The symbol that appears when using his  Charge of Darkness is the Taurus sign, which represents the earth element in astrology. The element is well represented by his  Strength attribute and his motif of iron, magnetism, and crystals all of which belong to the earth. Much like his fellow elemental planeswalker Leshrac, he can also manipulate the fabric of reality around him.",
      "Barathrum is a planeswalker. He originates from the elemental realm and has plane-shifted into the material plane, which is said to be a shadow of the former.",
      "He serves a hidden master.",
      "Nothing besides his title and Abaddon's statement considers him as an elemental, however. At the very least, his embodiment comes from the ichor of Nyctasha, the goddess of fear. Because his form comes from Nyctasha's divine blood, he is also said to be the essence of fear itself.",
      "His biography compares him to elemental species such as golems and gargoyles due to him being one with the earth just like them. It then proceeds to separate him from these elementals by saying that he serves no master, unlike most elementals.",
      "Also, he has been separated from his element due to taking on a form of flesh and blood. When he finally dies, he will return back to the earth.",
      "He also refers to gold as \"elemental gold\", which is a line reserved for elementals like Leshrac. It may refer to the speculation about Enigma being a universal alchemist who was cursed for his arrogance. In alchemy, gold and the the four elements of nature are important subjects.",
      "Adding further to his elemental nature, he has aligned himself with the elementals in Dota Underlords.",
      "The Phoenix that we are familiar with is but a shadow of his real form. Phoenix is actually a young star that has taken a terrestrial form resembling that of a fiery bird.",
      "Beyond Bristleback's statement, nothing (yet) suggests that he is an elemental, besides embodying flame in the form of a star.",
      "In Dota Underlords, he is classified as a Primordial Hero, an alliance which includes forces of nature like Fundamentals and elementals. He could be classified as the latter with his alignment to lightning.",
      "He hails from the Narrow Maze or the Underscape, which is implied to exist in a spiritual plane of existence. Despite being duty-bound to the afterlife, he has shifted out of those places, something that his master disapproves of.",
      "His master is Visage.",
      "Tiny speculates that he came from a splinter of a golem's heel or a chip from a gargoyle sculptor's workshop. Both entities are considered elementals according to Earthshaker's biography.",
      "He also may have came to life as a pebble on the river, which is a natural part of the environment. Earth Spirit claims that he was made from the soil, which is also a natural part of the environment.",
      "In Dota Underlords, he is classified as a Primordial Hero, an alliance which includes forces of nature like Fundamentals and elementals. He could be classified as the latter with his alignment to the earth.",
      "Earthshaker's bio classifies gargoyles as a type of elemental due to being one with the earth. As a gargoyle made of stone, he should qualify as well.",
      "This gargoyle hails from the Narrow Maze which is implied to exist in a spiritual plane of existence. He only shifts out of this plane to capture fugitive spirits who have managed to escape from their respective afterlife.",
      "His creator and master is Necro'lic.",
      "Forge Spirits embody the properties of the elements that create them. From Quas, they embody its properties of stubbornness, tenacity, and fortitude which makes up their durability and persistence\u2014the duration of their existence. From Exort, they embody its properties of strength, torridity, and brutality which makes up their damage output.",
      "Anyone who can summon them are considered as their masters. Notable masters include  Invoker and Culween.",
      "Elementals are beings that are completely harmonious or at one with nature. This affinity allows them to control and call upon the many elements found in nature to their will, depending on what element they represent.",
      "As previously stated, elementals are completely at one with nature. This means that they usually embody the aspect of nature that they represent: embodying the entirety of the element itself, borrowing aspects of nature into their form, or simply shaping their own body out of a specific element. This embodiment allows them to manipulate their respective elements to their will, and every power that they have focuses on their own elemental affinity.",
      "Some elementals may have a liminal existence or the ability to planeshift, which means that they exist on more than one plane of existence or they can freely travel between planes, respectively. They usually exist on the material plane to embody their worldly elements and become physically observable in the forms that we see them in, but they also exist on another hidden plane that is ethereal or outright otherworldly. Notable planes of existence include the Astral Plane and the elemental realm.",
      "Some elementals may serve a hidden master.",
      "Ancient Apparition, whose true name is Kaldr, is an elemental of ice. As an elemental, he can manipulate the cold aspects of nature, such as freezing temperatures, cold caustic winds, and ice storms.",
      "Leshrac, the Tormented Soul, was once a mundane philosopher who went to great lengths to find the meaning of existence. He was transformed into an elemental character after finding the horrifying truth at the heart of nature with the Chronoptic Crystals.",
      "Morphling is a water elemental who arrived to the planet of the Dota 2 world on a comet. He can call upon the watery element to wash his foes away and crush them in the great resilience or quickness of the ever-changing element of water.",
      "Spirit Breaker, also known as Barathrum, is an elemental being hailing from the elemental realm. He has borrowed the features of the bovian and simian creatures of the material plane to his physical avatar\u2014an outward expression of his strength, agility, and cunning. Outside of his physical form, Barathrum is an elemental intelligence\u2013meaning that his true form is actually a disembodied mind, much like the Ancients who are also classified as intelligences.",
      "Bane, also known as Atropos, is said to be a Bane Elemental. Abaddon also calls him an elemental, but it's unknown if Bane represents something in nature.",
      "Earthshaker is the earth itself given mortal form, He seems to qualify as an elemental, being one with the earth and having the ability to shape it, but the following reasons make his status ambiguous or anomalous at the very least.",
      "Enigma is obviously not an elemental, but when his \"pattern\" or \"form\" dissolves, he will return to the \"elemental force\" to reincarnate. However, his subordinate Kaldr calls him an elemental, further adding to the mystery of Enigma's true identity.",
      "Phoenix has been called an elemental by Bristleback.",
      "Razor, the Lightning Revenant, might be an elemental for the following reasons.",
      "Tiny's status as an elemental is as ambiguous as his origins. The information that follows is based on the speculations made by Tiny himself.",
      "Visage's lore does not explicitly classify him as an elemental, but it is somewhat evident in his features.",
      "Forged Spirit is an elemental that is conjured by invoking the powers of Quas and Exort.",
      "Golems and Gargoyles are implied to be elementals, according to Earthshaker's biography.\nStone Giants may be a type of elemental.\nWind elementals exist in  Windranger's lore."

Unlike their fuzzy cousins, the only fur they have is on their hands, which goes all the way to their elbows but not covering their forearms, and on their feet. They have no paws, but they have three large claws on their feet and prehensile hands. These hands are strong enough to break metal swords with their fists and create shockwaves with a clap that can throw lesser foes off of their footing. They have humanoid bodies with arms larger than their legs similar to those of the Ursa. Like all baby animals, hellbear cubs are regarded as cute.",

      "The Masked Ones are the natives of the Isle of Masks in the lore of Dota 2.",
      "As previously mentioned, the masked ones were exclusively native to the Isle of Masks. They may have also lived in the Ivory Isles, which might have been located within the island.",
      "Judging by their sole living representative, the masked ones are distinguished by the carved masks that they always wear over their face, which may even cover their entire head. The rest of their body has a fairly humanoid appearance with no deviations like extra fingers and toes.",
      "What lies underneath the masks of these strange people is a mystery. But it's known that their masks are symbols and expressions of many things, ranging from aspects of the wearer's personality, a symbol of their social status, ceremonial reasons, etc.",
      "The only known feature of their face is their blank eyes, but the rest of their visage beneath the mask remains as a mystery.",
      "This race is rich and diverse in many kinds of culture.",
      "Masks are such a central aspect of the Masked ones' culture, so it deserves a separate section. Their masks are crafted out of birch wood or ivory, before it is carved into shape and painted over with a unique design.",
      "From the common folks to the noble lords, it is implied that having a mask is a sign that one's honor is still intact, as it is stripped away from them if they commit a dishonorable crime, such as violating an established creed.",
      "As previously stated in the Appearance section of this page, their masks are symbols and expressions of many things. It can even be said that their masks, in place of their hypothetical faces, are an expression of self. One mask may capture the aspects of an entity, such as the wearer's fury during battle, the cunning and the horror of alien beasts, and the revered aspects of animals. Masks can express a variety of messages, such as intimidation. Masks can also signify one's social status--a ceremonial mask is bestowed upon those who have graduated into a true swordmaster and masks of shame are given to the Isle's exiled Ronin.",
      "Even animals are subject to this tradition. All beasts of burden such as yaks who serve others in battle must wear a thrice-blessed Mask of Duty to signify their status as a noble animal courier.",
      "Long before its destruction, worshippers used to travel to the Temple of Masks to commit various rituals and activities of their faith. Now, it is lost to the depths, but its only remaining worshipper still keeps its memory in the rites that he continues to practice even during battles. The Visage of Vengeance may have been kept in this temple as one of the many idol masks sworn to by its visitors.",
      "The masked ones are polytheistic and worship a pantheon, of which only two of them are known by name. These named deities include the Maker of Masks and the Boar God.",
      "On the Isle, death is said to have many watchful eyes.",
      "Bladework and swordplay are one of the Isle's most prominent cultures. It's implied that there are various martial arts in the Isle, but only one is known by its name, techniques, and its sole living practitioner. The long standing Juggernaut tradition, a heritage with a commitment to bladework, focuses on swordplay and rituals. Every technique performed is an expression of self or a work of art.",
      "There was once a forgotten school of swordsmanship that existed long before Yurnero's time, just before the apex of the Isle of Masks. The Lost Order, an esoteric group of elders who were skilled with their metaphysical blade, established a new school of Mastery. The practitioners of this school learned the ability to pierce the fabric of reality with their swords and passed it on to their disciples, while recording such techniques in parchment. They would soon learn that tampering with the natural world will elicit repercussions far beyond the field of battle. Lest that they may invite dire outcomes that we know very little about, the elders burned every parchment and slew all of their students before finally turning their own blades on themselves.",
      "The Kuur-Ishiminari is a craft-clan that consists of stoneworkers who are best known for their jade crafts, but there are also sculptors and swordsmiths among them. Many generations ago, they created swords made out of jade as a symbol of grand nobility. They also made gargoyles and spirit-watchers made out of jade.",
      "Sabasteen was an ancient bladesmith who may be from the Isle. More than a thousand years ago, he forged a beautiful sword that can produce elegant strikes.",
      "The Serrakura is a sword forged by an unnamed masked swordsmith. The sword is said to be a deadly blossom with its petals serrated like the sharpest knife. Its description might be a metaphor, the sword being the source (the blossom) of the deadly swings and strikes (its petals) it can produce when swung.",
      "Little is known about the Masked Ones' cuisine besides the fact that they have spices and seasonings that are stored safely in trunks. Because of its value, it is sought after by rich food connoisseurs, such as the gastromancer Remi who seeks to join the White Orchids with these rare spices on a meal. They also had 100 proof alcohol kept in big jugs or bottles.",
      "The uniform of a warrior consists of a kataginu, a traditional sleeveless jacket that bears the banner of its wearer, and a traditional hakama. A sleeveless kimono may also be worn by warriors of the Isle of Masks. Warriors may carry banners on their back to celebrate a battle.",
      "To the lords of the Isle, clothing seems to be an important factor in determining how influential they are. A lord that is so adorned is said to bend the will of many people.",
      "With no particular order, the society of the Masked Ones consists of the highborn lords who govern the people, followed by the warriors, craftspeople, and the common folks. But it is implied that there are warrior-kings among these strange people. Whether they are also the highborn lords of the Isle or just separate leaders is unknown.",
      "Juggernaut is the sole surviving member of this race who was saved from their extinction by being banished from the Isle for his crimes. Were it not for his survival, none of the Isle of Masks' cultures and traditions would have been preserved today.",
      "His status as the last of his kind didn't last forever. Unbeknownst to him, his own mask is actually the vessel of the dormant souls of his warrior ancestors, an ancient lineage of revered warriors. In life, they were branded as traitors to the Isle, denied a noble death, and stripped of their honor, similar to their descendant Yurnero. These sleeping souls would soon be reawakened when their vessel was cut in half by Sven with the Adjudicator's Blade restoring a small portion of the Masked Ones' presence back to life. Now at one with the being of Yurnero, they seek to reclaim their lost honor and restore the Isle of Masks and its people, which will all be achieved once their opposing Ancient has been destroyed.",
      "Sabasteen was an ancient bladesmith who may be from the Isle.",
      "The Faceless Ones are the dishonorable outcasts of the Isle's society. They are the lowest class in the Isle's society because they are victimized by the common folks and the high lords alike. They are called \"faceless\" because it derives from the idiom \"lose face\" which means losing the respect (or honor, in this case) of others. This goes in line with the Faceless Ones being stripped of their masks and honor.",
      "By violating one creed or another, a Masked One will be stripped of their masks and honors before being banished to the outskirts of society, never to  influence the Isle's affairs again. The only people worse than them are those who defend these outcasts even against the highborn lords of the Isle. These miscreants have no place in society or the Isle itself for doing such crimes, and so they are exiled from the Isle of Masks to never return.",
      "Just like the Isle and its people, they were also drowned beneath the boiling waves. But their rituals carry on in the dishonorable one who defended them, who still practices their rites in their absence by the deluged Visage of Vengeance."

      "Stars are a race of cosmic beings in the Dota 2 world.",
      "In the lore of Dota 2, stars are literally what one would expect them to be, except that stars in the lore of Dota 2 are sentient lifeforms. Stars are luminous spheres in space created by the weak force, held together by gravity, which also causes it to collapse on itself over time until it bursts into a supernova. The core of a star, which is its heart, is extremely hot and is rich in metals and ores that can be used in forging, whether if it's a young star or a dead star. Their ever-collapsing core may often emit short-lived bursts of conscious light.",
      "Stars possess an essence known as its spark. This spark is what allows them to create and give life. It's implied that older stars can pass down their spark to their descendants.",
      "The first stars were born from the gift of the rider of Light. In the earliest times of the universe, Ezalor used his staff to spark the heat of the first sun in the universe and countless other stars like it. This primordial star was not just a massive sphere of fire, it was a conscious entity in itself. Over untold amounts of time, gravity caused this star to collapse on its core, coalescing its incalculable energy, until it burst into a supernova. Although this marked the end of the first sun's life, it was a crucible for the birth of many other stars just like it. The first sun's children would also burst into supernova soon, and this phenomenon of supernova will repeat until the cold vacuum of space shined with the light and warmth of an endless array of stars. The stars themselves move across the dark heavens made by the Elder Titan in search of illumination.",
      "Ezalor was not the only one who can create these stars. Just like how he gave life and light to the stars, he created a winged horse that shared his ability to spark the heat of suns.",
      "Gravity is involved in both the creation and the death of a star. When a star dies, it may become a cold and passive dark star or simply fade into nothing.",
      "Phoenix is a young wandering star, a distant descendant of the first sun's lineage. He is unique among his solar kin who are content with finding their place within the cosmos and settling down in constellations. Instead, his curiosity led him to discover the battle of the Ancients, prompting him to assume the terrestrial form of a fiery bird and soar through the endless cosmos to aid those who needs his light and search for his solar destiny.",
      "Dawnbreaker was forged from the heart of a young star. Because of this, she is the embodiment of its heart.",
      "The Children of Light are a great faction of stars who were all descendants of the Keeper's first sun. They were the earliest and most powerful branches of the now-vast lineage of the Keeper's first sun. They tried to align other stars to their cause, but even stars have dissonant politics among themselves. Thus they dispatched their herald Dawnbreaker to shatter the rebels or set them back to rights.",
      "The sun that shines upon the planet where the Nemesis Stones crashed upon is responsible for the light that Selemene's moon (not the Mad Moon) is said to have. It is a very young star relative to Dawnbreaker's age.",
      "The Demon Star can be seen between the tips of a crescent moon.",
      "There is a star called Dragon, which has plasmic residue that can be used for forging armor.",
      "Keeper of the Light and  Enigma are the two Fundamentals responsible for the existence of a star. Ezalor creates stars using his weak force powers, while Enigma creates them by coalescing the remains of a supernova. The latter is also responsible for its death via supernova.",
      "Mirana's connection to the stars and heavenly bodies is very intimate. Her devotion to astrology gives her intimate knowledge on the stars and the powers granted to her by the moon goddess Selemene bring the stars themselves even closer to her.",
      "Oracle can see the future (or even futures) by reading the constellations in the sky.",
      "Selemene's power heavily relies on the stars. Her control over the night sky allows her to manipulate its aspects, such as the constellations of stars that are best seen at night and the beams of light that they produce.",
      "The Solar Goddess is a dilution of a greater line of star progeny.",
      "The mythologies of sea-dwelling creatures often look to the moon and stars for wisdom and guidance.",
      "The Nightsilver Woods was sanctified by a shard of stellar origin that fell to the woods. The Shrine of Selemene was built around this holy crash site and the shard itself was fashioned into a sacred weapon of the Dark Moon Order, now wielded by  Luna. Those who trespass into the woods are smited by Selemene's beams of starlight.",
      "Weeping Rose is shrouded in perpetual nightfall, so that the stars of the night sky are always visible and available for The Quorum to harness their power.",
      "In the lore of Dota 2, stars are an important subject that are studied by fields of knowledge related to them and other heavenly bodies. For centuries, the wise aesthetes of Keyturn studied the movement of celestial bodies from their mountain keep, recording their arrangements in the Book of Heavens. Through these observations, they found out that the wheel of the world was a thing of many moving parts\u2014a clock of strange rhythms and irregular meter. By studying the wheeling of the celestial bodies, they counted the number of dawns in each season, and calculated the day of the longest night. It can be said that they were the first timekeepers in history, if there wasn't any before them.",
      "The  Solar Crest was made to honor the daytime sky. The luster of this item is very bright.",
      "The  Meteor Hammer was forged out of metals that were found in the ruins of a village destroyed by a star storm.",
      "Silencer owns a glaive forged from the ores of a dead star's heart, located in a corner of the universe devoid of sound.",
      "The  Chaos Knight sometimes wields a blade that's forged in the heat of a dying star.",

      "Rizzrack's people was evidently a technological one, with the ability to create machinery to cut down trees. From the Treant Protectors' perspective, this would make them a threat, and therefore a target for destruction.",
      "Given the similar toponyms of Augury Bay and Vale of Augury, one can assume the locations are close to each other, and therefore the first to be discovered and attacked.",
      "The residents of Augury Bay were killed by entangling vines and roots, similar to Treant Protector's  Overgrowth.",
      "The events of Augury Bay may have been inspired by the events of 'The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers', \"The Last March of the Ents\".",
      "Treant Protectors are an ancient race that resemble large, mobile trees. They are usually hidden among the foliage and rarely seen. Charged with protecting their land and its secrets, the Protectors are extremely long-lived and notoriously fierce in their duties. Because of their longevity, time appears to pass quickly for them, and patience is one of their natural virtues.  Like normal trees, Treant Protectors possess the same plant characteristics. They consume water through their roots, which double as feet. Lifesap flows through their bodies, which grow and bloom, and require sunlight for nourishment. Unlike regular plants, however, they appear to need sleep. Because of their self-imposed isolation, Treant Protectors know little of things in the outside world, as evidenced by Rooftrellen's confusion when met with gold and items.",
      "Sworn to defend the helpless, Treant Protectors are able to sap the life from trespassers, transferring their vitality to their allies. Their roots and tendrils reach far and wide, where they emerge to shield and rejuvenate allies. As expected, the Protectors fear axes and fire, and heroes who wield them.",
      "The best known Protector is Rooftrellen, sent out by his kind to explore the world, and report any threats that could endanger their homeland. On his forehead, Rooftrellen wears a special runestone. What this signifies is unknown. Whether or not the Treant Protectors are related to  Nature's Prophet's treants is also unknown. Rooftrellen can summon the Spirit of Nature to release its power, causing an  Overgrowth of vines and roots. It is unknown whether this ability is unique to him, or available to all Protectors.",
      "It is generally assumed that Treant Protectors attacked Augury Bay, destroying the city and killing its inhabitants. A flood preceded the attack, during which the attacks took \"root\" beyond the city walls. During this attack, it was revealed by Rizzrack that the Protectors strangled residents to death with vines, and their blooming flowers floated on the waters, releasing toxic clouds of pollen.  It is likely that Rooftrellen was the one to identify Augury Bay as a threat, and therefore called on subsequent Protectors to assault the city.",
      "The Treant Protectors live within unnamed mountains beyond the Vale of Augury, far to the west. Within the woods lies the remains of an ancient power that continuously emits a strange energy. The life forms in this land are dangerous and unusual, including \"all-consuming grasses\", crossbred animals, and poisonous flowers. It is a sacred, hidden place, but not to outsiders, who arrived to cut and burn down the forest. Some Protectors may also inhabit Roseleaf.",
      "The Protectors were able to defend their lands, apparently killing the intruders. Faced with this threat, the Protectors spent a long period of time to discuss their situation, and finally decided to send out Rooftrellen to observe the outside world.",
      "Described by Rizzrack, a group of \"Walking Trees\" laid waste to Augury Bay, killing its inhabitants. These walking trees may be reasonably assumed to be the Treant Protectors, for two reasons:",
      "Contradicting this theory is the fact that Treant Protectors are generally benevolent, resorting to violence only when needed to stop trespassers. Furthermore, only one Protector, Rooftrellen, was sent out into the outside world. However, due to the Treant Protectors' extremely long view of time, more events may have transpired since his departure.  Timbersaw was also added to Dota 2 seven months after  Treant Protector, making this theory plausible.",
      "Although the parasitic stuntwood is normally deadly to trees, the Treant Protectors seem to welcome their presence."

Their lower jaws have two fangs that may or may not protrude from the corners of their mouths, much like some species of ogres. The size of these fangs may vary between each troll. As a species, the amount of fingers and toes they have can vary between each troll. Trolls can have a minimum of three fingers, but some may have four or even five fingers. This is also applicable to their toes, but the amount of toes and fingers that one troll can have isn't always equal to each other. Trolls also have pointed ears and pointed noses that face downwards.",
      "Depending on the species, trolls can have different skin colors. Green colored skin is commonly seen in hill trolls and dark trolls, but some trolls have chartreuse skin. Jah'rakal has red colored skin, something that has not been seen among other trolls.",
      "The intelligence of trolls can vary between subspecies, but in general they are fairly intelligent beings. They are intelligent enough to form societies and properly enunciate their respective tongues. Some of the wiser trolls have the intelligence to utilize magic, even at a young age.",
      "The culture of trolls can vary between subspecies and populations. Some trolls are more accustomed to the mundane life of living in societies with their own kin or with other people, but some trolls are more esoteric and arcane. Trolls can quickly adapt to different cultures when exposed to them long enough.",
      "To those trolls who dabble in the arcane, they are commonly known to use haruspicy, a form of divination that involves the inspection of the entrails and remains of living things to see the future.",
      "A separate population of trolls live in the Bleeding Hills, and are referred to as hill trolls. Rhasta, the  Shadow Shaman, is half hill-troll. Jah'rakal believes Hill Trolls are the weakest of trolls, and can be barely considered trolls at all.",
      "Some Hill Trolls have a degree of combat skill. Hill Trolls who prefer hand-to-hand combat may wield akimbo crude axes or one crude axe with a cowhide shield on their offhand. Hill Trolls also wield magic, such as the priests who have the ability to replenish the health and mana of their allies.",
      "The Dark Trolls are an esoteric group of trolls with the ability to raise the dead. While the exact location of their homeland is unknown, it can be presumed that they live somewhere in the landmass where Stonehall is located. They are known to be forest dwellers, but a forest fire has led them to abandon their home. In response, the Dark Troll chieftain J'Muy led the few remaining trolls on an exodus to Weeping Rose, where he seeks an audience with the Quorum to grant them asylum. The Dark Trolls may either be a group that consists of an existing troll species who are only differentiated by their necromantic powers or an entirely different kind of troll.",
      "Monger Trolls are native to the Hoven lands, where they are born and raised in the underground dens of their parents. They are easily offended and unfriendly to other people, even going so far as to argue with their own kind with raised voices. Long after they have grown past the age of maturity, they will stubbornly refuse to leave their quarters while freeloading off of their parents' supplies until they are forced out into the world. From there, they form packs of Monger Trolls who participate in all sorts of misconduct.",
      "Jah'rakal, the  Troll Warlord, is a Monger Troll that was considered intolerable by his former gang. He was beaten and banished from their camp, but he came back to slay his \"cohorts\" before he became the troll that he is today.",
      "Some Trolls live in the mountainous valleys of Knollen, where they are hostile with the Keen. Brag Sharpeye,  Sniper's grandfather, was known to shoot the toes off trolls from great distances.",

Fully grown zealot scarabs are covered by a chitinous exoskeleton, with an elevated thorax that leads to an upright head. While their carapaces are relatively thin, each scarab possess retractable spikes to deter attackers. Zealot scarabs have eight appendages, six of which are walking legs, with the two frontal appendages acting as manipulators. Two elongated mandibles jut out from under two eyes, sometimes with teeth. Some zealot scarabs have a stinger that protrudes from their abdomen, capable of killing prey.",
      "All Zealot Scarabs are telepathic, and live in communal colonies. All scarabs have intimate knowledge of their underground tunnels, and share them among each other. The hive experiences regular \"cyclings\", although what this entails is unknown.",
      "As with other social insects, grubs undergo differing metamorphoses depending on their designated caste, with each caste being physically different to suit their tasks. Some castes are known for digging small burrows, where they lie in wait for potential prey. Not counting the queen, there are a total of four castes. Higher caste zealot scarabs are known to make use of armor and metallic claw extensions.",
      "The Zealot Scarabs are ruled by their Nyx, their queen goddess, who lives in a special chamber, possibly in the Hidden Hive. She secretes a special substance, which she uses to anoint a single chosen grub, triggering a unique metamorphosis. Not all chosen grubs survive this process. The one that does becomes the Nyx Assassin, whose purpose is to fulfill Nyx's highest calling\u2013killing in the name of his queen. The motives behind Nyx's assassination orders are unknown.",
      "Little is known of the reproductive caste, or how its members relate to the queen.",
      "Nothing is known of the soldier caste.",
      "The worker caste is the base unit of the colony. Workers are inundated with \"plodding thoughts\" of duty, likely controlled by the queen.",
      "The Nyx Assassin is considered a separate caste unto himself. It is the fourth and highest caste, after the queen, and consists of only one member. There is always at least one living Nyx Assassin. The Nyx Assassin was described by the tome in the Ultimyr Archives, which noted his extraordinary telepathic powers.",
      "Unlike the other scarabs, the Nyx Assassin has an exceptionally sharp mind, and is able to eat away at the minds of lesser beings. With this latent telepathy, the Nyx Assassin can project his thoughts into those around him, as well as hear the thoughts of others. He is larger, with sharper foreclaws and toothed mandibles. After being blessed by his queen, the Nyx Assassin acquired strange new energies. Like other zealot scarabs, the Nyx Assassin can burrow into the earth, often deeper down than his brethren.",
      "New Nyx Assassins are given a special set of claw armor when he completes his first assignment. For every three kills he makes, he is granted a ceremonial horn. He must continue to complete assassinations in order to keep this horn.",
      "A special colony called the Hidden Hive is reserved for Nyx and her assassin, as well as unnamed others. When a new Nyx Assassin is chosen, he is sent to the Hidden Hive for confirmation. Here, ceremonies are performed, armor is bestowed, and the queen shares her schemes with her underlings.",

However, a swift rotting disease that was beyond Azorszos' skill claimed the lives of Ostarion's royal family. The young prince Ostarion inherited the throne as a result, but the disease nearly claimed him as well were it not for Azorszos' desperate measures.",
      "Invoking powerful magics, Azorszos submitted his newfound lord to an ossification ritual, stripping away his vulnerable flesh and turning him into a being of animated bone which nullified the disease. On the other hand, Azorszos unwittingly stood close enough to the ritual's area of effect to also be ossified by his own spell, but not close enough to be fully scoured\u2014leaving his nervous system intact.",
      "For the next nine centuries, he would live with his mistake of creating a monster out of desperation. His nerves would also succumb to leprosy without being able to die from it, leaving him to feel raw pain for many centuries. Many were the attempts that he made to beg to his king for the sweet release of death, but none of them were fulfilled.",
      "He would soon find his opportunity to leave the mortal coil when Ostarion violently consulted him about the haunted solstice known as Wraith-Night. The longest night of the year, just before Frostivus, where the barrier between the planes grows thin and wraith flesh floods into the world of the living where it can be harvested in large amounts, using up the collected essence to form a brand new incorporeal body. Although Azorszos had his concerns about Ostarion's transfiguration into something more dreadful than a skeleton, and the fate of the world that must bear his presence from now on, he was all too eager to share the dark mysteries of the ritual when his liege promised his sacrifice should the ritual go well.",
      "And now, Azorszos must repeat history as he transforms his king once again into a deathless being. He placed his king into a magical trance so he may absorb the Wraith Essence released by his royal knights from the hordes of night. He was never heard of again, but it should be safe to assume that he was sacrificed like everyone else during the ritual, since no one but the newly reborn Wraith King survived the night.\n\n"

Lion fought tooth and nail with Buki'vak and successfully defeated him in battle, allowing him to claim his hand.

His left hand had three fingers that were red and edgy, while the rest of his hand was purple. There are spikes all over his forearm as well as his knuckles.",

      "Harlek is nowhere to be seen in the show Dota: Dragon's Blood, but Harlek's  Sun Strike does make an appearance, used by none other than the Invoker. This spell, when unused but reserved for immediate casting later on, appeared as a floating orb of fire in front of the Invoker. He brought this orb with him when he confronted Vahdrak, the Father of Chaos, in the dragons' dream.",
      "After a brief conversation between the two, the Invoker prepared to finish off the Thunder by killing Vahdrak. He cast his spell, splitting his flame orb into Quas, Wex, and Exort before they orbited him once and flew into the dark, cloudy sky. A twinkle of light appeared above them where the orbs went up, then an expanding light. Not long after, that light flashed briefly before it shot a beam of light upon Vahdrak, killing him.",
      "Not only is Harlek absent from the show, but the Invoker also doesn't use the right orbs (which is three Exort orbs) for casting Sun Strike. The change might have been done because of the new lore surrounding nature's elements. Since the elements are the Eldwyrms themselves and the whole of the Eldwurms is the Worldwyrm, invoking the power of the Sun (which is also the Worldwyrm) requires the Invoker to combine all the elements. This is just speculation, though.",
      "In his youth, the  Invoker learned Harlek's  Sun Strike alongside the nine other spells he currently wields, using three Exort orbs to invoke this spell for casting.",
      "The forgotten Sol Apex Incantation grants its caster access to the Sun's might, which includes a spell akin to  Sun Strike. It's unknown if Harlek has any relation to this magic.",

Otherwise, Harlek would not be able to have  Sun Strike (also known as Exort Tri-Solar or Harlek's Incantation of Incineration) which requires three Exort orbs (or Exort Trionis) to invoke.",
      "This spell channels a devastating ray of energy from the Sun towards the target location, incinerating anyone caught below the sun's concentrated ferocity.",

Slyrak opened his mouth and unleashed another round of his fiery breath, which was promptly blocked by a magical shield held by Kaden's captain and teacher. However, the barrier wasn't enough to shield his team from the flames and the fire broke through before it incinerated everyone in its path, save for Kaden.",
      "Alone in the rubble, he found the charred remains of the captain's upper torso reaching out to him. Traumatized, he rode out of the dragon razed city of Leathsham by himself, swearing vengeance against the crimson dragon that evaporated all that was dear to him.",
      "20 years later, Kaden has risen amongst the ranks of Dragonhold as a powerful but brooding Dragon Knight; still haunted by his firsthand experience with an Eldwurm. His experience with dragons earned him his extensive knowledge on their species. Such knowledge has granted him the skill and confidence to fight against fully grown dragons (which would normally require a large army to defeat) as well as slay every type of dragon, including the dangerous void and chaos types.",
      "According to Wren, Kaden speaks highly of Davion. The feeling is reciprocated by Davion, who feels that he is proud of his accomplishments. Book 3 hinted that he is Davion's biological father, and gave Davion the dragon teeth necklace when the ember dragon attacked his hometown, killing Davion's parents.",
      "Even after twenty years, Kaden holds a grudge against Slyrak for murdering his friends. He seeks nothing but his destruction, not knowing that his life is essential to the existence of the universe. Even if someone's life is literally barring the way to Slyrak, he will not hesitate to harm them just to force Slyrak out of \"hiding\". Still, he is very careful with that person, especially if it's someone that he's familiar with.",
      "Kaden wears a powerful set of plated armor made from the remains of each dragon that he has slain. The armor allows him to channel the elemental powers of each dragon that he has slain as well as utilize their stolen physical strength.",
      "He wields a blade that is aptly named as Kaden's Blade, a massive sword that deals extra damage to bigger opponents. Judging by the area near its hilt, it is forged from the remains of a void dragon. It contains a dormant power that can be activated to cause the sword to strike opponents with equivalent mass, meaning that he can hit any opponent larger than him as though the sword has enough weight and power to knock it down, despite the sheer difference in size and weight between them."

However, by unknown means, he was tricked by the occult investigator Vanessa and bound into a temporary but lengthy contract (presumably a magical contract) that would force him into servitude in the mortal plane where his powers and potential to become a great demon lord would rot in their world. What he didn't lose however, was his birthright as the ruler of the Court of Ristul, which was sought out by Akasha, the  Queen of Pain.",
      "After Knogh was tricked into servitude by Vanessa, the rulers of the Court of Ristul was reduced to three lords.  Shadow Fiend,  Underlord, and B'kor decided to split the rule over the court into three ways rather than four. Thus eliminating Knogh's clan from their position of power and putting them under the heel of the three new demon lords.",
      "Back in the mortal plane, Akasha decided to increase her status within the Court of Ristul, tired of her brother B'Kor's constant mocking. She sought out the fallen demon prince Knogh, who serves Vanessa in the magical town of Weeping Rose. She informed him about the happenings below when Knogh was away from his home realm: the division of power between the three demon lords, the demotion of Knogh's clan, etc. However, Knogh was merely frustrated by Akasha mentioning his failures, but she had more to tell him besides that. She proposed a power transfer between the two of them, since the contract made Knogh unable to freely travel back to the Seven Hells, rendering his powers useless in the current plane that he resides in.",
      "Knogh agreed to give her his birthright, transferring the ownership of the lands and powers associated with his clan. He agreed to this transfer of power, because he'd have no place to go back to once his contract had ended. Once he gave away his birthright, he became a normal demon with no power over the Court of Ristul or his clan."

Clinkz unwittingly earned the spell, which combined with Maraxiform's last breath to preserve him as the Hellfire torments him forever.",
      "Maraxiform rose to the Hoven from a gate to the Sixth Hell with the intention of claiming the forest. This demon attacked the arboreal kingdom until Clinkz battled the beast in mortal combat, driven back to the threshold of the fiery gates, where this demon died to his last arrow, but not without letting out one last blast of Hellfire that incinerated Clinkz and ignited the Hoven's tar pools.",
      "Maraxiform is a demon of the sixth level of the Seven Hells, whence he rises from into the mortal plane through fiery gates.",
      "As a demon, Maraxiform had the natural ability to breathe Hellfire. Hellfire can cremate lesser beings in mere seconds and is eternal with its ability to burn and torture the soul.",
      "Besides a power over Hellfire, Maraxiform must've had the other general powers of a demon, such as the heat of Hell in their veins and an immortal rage.",
      "An interesting thing to notice is that Maraxiform had this power to travel to the mortal plane from the Sixth Hell through fiery gates, something that only the Demon Lords are capable of doing with their explicit access to this plane. This implies that Maraxiform must've been a very powerful demon, unless someone else helped the demon enter this world..."

Instead, he recommends going to the Black Market in Hauptstadt to see Nikdo, who will help her in locating the lotuses. Unsatisfied, Mirana rejects his offer and reminds him of his job of retrieving items, not names. He insists on being paid for that, but Mirana refuses to pay only for a name, so he replies that he will cancel the bargain with Nikdo and leaves.",

Gwanwyn mistakes the offer for prostituting herself and withsays, mockingly telling her that Human Women are \"pleasantly soft but too easy to come by.\" This provokes Marci who stands from her seat to fight him, only to be halted by Mirana who corrects him. She hands Her bracelet to him, who recognizes Mirana's identity through it and her circlet. He is suddenly interrupted by a perverted villager and his pals, the former intending to take Mirana and Marci as his women.",

Mirana and Marci discover and inspect Nikdo's portrait on the wall before Mirana takes a seat while Marci stands guard beside her. The doors in front of them open as four beefy bodyguards enter the room, followed by the man himself. Nikdo introduces himself to the pair and asks for their names, but Mirana gets straight to business, and confirms if he has info on the location of a certain rare artifact. Nikdo confirms that to some extent, saying that he knows much, but like Gwanwyn before him, he seeks payment for his services. Mirana replies by revealing herself as the most favored of her Moon-Goddess Selemene and that he will be rewarded handsomely by her goddess if he helps them.",

Realizing that she has been betrayed, Gwanwyn reveals that he was working for her uncle Shabarra all along to return her to the Helio Imperium. After stealing her circlet without resistance, Mirana expresses her regrets of not leaving him to be killed by the villagers in Barrowhaven. Gwanwyn then leaves Marci and Mirana to Nikdo and his men to be taken to the jails downstairs to be trafficked and returned to Shabarra, respectively. He is never seen again after this.",

With his talents, Rhasta was able to dazzle crowds with shocking displays of lightning, and turning himself into a chicken at the end of each performance. The old con-man himself also performed various small services for money. For two pins of copper, the old con-man would tells someone's fortune. For three, he\u2019d castrate your pig, for five, he\u2019d circumcise your sons. These services were advertised on pictures drawn on banners, which Rhasta worn on his back. Before their swindled customers could catch up to him, he and Rhasta would leave for the next town, and continue their trade there.",

He gave Rhasta advice on his future travels, telling him to \"Be clear what you are about, for these simple village folk read menace and evil intent into poor communication.\" Therefore Rhasta created a simple visual menu of the services he offers, and wears it in plain sight. He also joked with his young apprentice. \"A shaman must take good care of his skin!\" He instructed. \"Therefore, always wear a hat to keep off the sun, and no less the evil influence of the moon.\" And then the old man always broke into laughter. \"And if you believe that, I have a bag of herbs here that will confer infinite wealth and immortality.\"",
      "Eventually, the con-man's cheated clients caught up to him and Rhasta. The pair was ambushed by a mob in the Bleeding Hills, and in the ensuing fight, the con-man was killed. In a fit of rage, Rhasta used his magic to kill their assailants, avenging his master in the process."

      "My employers have a lot riding on this camp.",
      "With what they spent on that foolish labyrinth, could've built proper towers...",
      "Longclaw was no friend, but Rhyzik... Well, there's a reason this camp's preparing for refugees.",
      "Don't like to admit it, but that old howler found my scent.",
      "If you're bound for Kalabor, there's a shortcut southeast of camp. Through the old temple.",
      "It's a hard road... We don't open the Grimwal Gate often. You need two Orbs of Passage to get through.",
      "One Orb is hidden in a... haven to the west. The other one's with the patrol that vanished up north.",
      "Last patrol didn't come back.",
      "Starting to wonder if the Weald is any safer than Kalabor.",
      "Targan might be a hired hand, but he's a fine commander.",
      "Not sure about his employers though...",
      "Lot of new folks due here any day.",
      "Don't see many travelers arrive from the west...",
      "We could use a sword like yours around here.",
      "Wet enough for you?",
      "Camp's going to grow fast.",
      "We have to make camp safe for them.",
      "We'll even need a school.",
      "That don't appeal to you?",
      "I hope some healers arrive soon.",
      "You'd be welcome to join us.",
      "Looking for a fresh start?",
      "Won't be able to turn around without running into someone.",
      "Probably see a few tempers flare before long.",
      "Where did you say you're from?",
      "You came through the Weald alone?",
      "Didn't think anyone was that crazy.",
      "Recently arrived here myself.",
      "Never rains like this back home.",
      "I don't miss all that sand one bit.",
      "You just passing through?",
      "Lot of new faces in camp.",
      "Wonder how long they'll survive.",
      "Your group looks of the right sort.",
      "Everyone's running here to escape Kalabor...",
      "We got our own problems.",
      "The refugees are tough. I'll give 'em that.",
      "Not like this... Not like this.",
      "I came here to get away from stuff like this!",
      "Hungry ogres!",
      "Arrogant wizards!",
      "Should've taken my chances with Rhyzik...",
      "At least the water's nice...",
      "I don't want any trouble...",
      "Got my eye on you...",
      "Your banners are a welcome sight!",
      "You look like you can handle yourself out there.",
      "How do you even swing that thing?",
      "Don't know why everyone's on edge.",
      "Those howlers'll never get through the stockade.",
      "I dug those posts myself.",
      "I'm sure the missing soldiers are fine.",
      "The next caravan from Kalabor should arrive soon.",
      "Pretty soon this camp'll be a full-fledged town.",
      "I'll tell my grandkids about this!",
      "For those butchered in our dens!",
      "Outsmarted by ogres... Ugh. Take this Orb of Passage. If you're really hunting Rhyzik, we'll be close behind.",
      "We'll retreat from Rhyzik's swarm no farther. Give word and I'll sound the attack.",
      "Today we show them what Kalabor's defenders are made of!",
      "Please! Find the Captain!",
      "Good luck. I'm out of here!",
      "Orb of Passage? Captain might have one.",
      "Time to move back home and take over dad's farm.",
      "This place is almost worse than Kalabor.",
      "I traded sunburn and centaurs for a soggy cage and hungry ogres.",
      "I knew someone would come!",
      "Once I'm patched up, these ogres are done for!",
      "Thought I was gonna die in a stew pot!",
      "Is the camp safe? I saw the hounds gathering...",
      "KILL ANKABOOT FIRST!",
      "Want a baby crawly. But crawly momma got mad. You save! Thanks! ... Want more crawlies! Hah-hah!!",
      "The fools here think me Gallaron, but some know me by a different name...",
      "Such grand plans for this labyrinth... Yet the imbeciles speak of budgets!",
      "Their cause is scarce worth my notice. But I do have a fondness for orbs.",
      "Dare you purchase a treasure from Quas Wex Exports?",
      "Thought I could skip the mountain pass and take the old shortcut to Kalabor. Bad idea!",
      "Spiders and wolves I can handle. But I'm not going to dull my blade on flying gargoyles!",
      "Seekers of the sunken one\u2014he who sleeps in the vault. We bring words of warning.",
      "The foul Rhyzik, swimmer in the sands, is more than Siltbreaker's pawn against the drylanders.",
      "Rhyzik carries inside him a measure of his master's essence.",
      "If this vile reservoir can be destroyed, the denizen of Dark Reef will falter.",
      "Far to the north, a small outpost of resistance makes a final stand.",
      "Without your help, these lands will fall to Rhyzik's swarms. And Siltbreaker's influence will grow.",
      "Stop Rhyzik's advance. Only then can our portal hasten your journey to Dark Reef.",
      "You have done much, but more work remains.",
      "Take this portal to Dark Reef, and the true task at hand.",
      "We lost too much retaking the outpost. Can't let anyone through while the area's still so overrun. Destroy the Centaur Warlords and I can let you pass.",
      "It's time to make the final push. Captain Lightfoot and his men wait across the bridge. They'll march with you against Rhyzik.",
      "Any of you seen another way to town around here? I mean, I'm not lost\u2014I know where town is. Just... the bandits got me cornered.",
      "With you here, maybe it's ok! Just let me know when you're ready.",
      "Kalabor's this way. They won't open the gate for strangers, so don't leave me behind!",
      "We finally recaptured the northern outpost near Rhyzik's stronghold. But the dunes outside of town are still crawling with those... things.",
      "Where the Hell is that guy?",
      "It's his turn in the watchtower.",
      "I'm not going to sit up there all damn day.",
      "Why did I marry into that stupid family!",
      "He's probably asleep somewhere.",
      "When I find him...",
      "Know those family members you could just strangle?",
      "Ever wish you could leave it all behind?",
      "Take pride in what you do, or don't do it. Right?",
      "Throw a rock around here and you'll hit that idiot napping.",
      "He never had to work a day in his life.",
      "Or has his head in a darn book!",
      "Makes me want to smack him!",
      "I'll have to help him remember what time it is.",
      "Is there a cure for laziness?",
      "Some people just aren't go-getters.",
      "I need to get away from him for awhile.",
      "And here I am pouring my soul out to an absolute stranger!",
      "I'm about ready to throw a fit!",
      "All the other families already left town.",
      "Ma's stubborn. Born and raised in Kalabor.",
      "She ain't leaving.",
      "Heck, I was born and raised here, too.",
      "Only reason I'm still here is her!",
      "What I wouldn't give to see the ocean.",
      "All the same, only got one ma'...",
      "And she's got rocks in her head!",
      "I should stand up to her.",
      "I wonder if a temple would take her...",
      "Wouldn't expect someone like you to understand.",
      "But what are you without family?",
      "Why do the people you love make you feel so bad?",
      "It's nice to get this out...",
      "I guess she always has been there for me...",
      "We just want different things.",
      "Wish my brother were still around...",
      "Maybe something can light a fire under her...",
      "Leaving would cost a piece of my soul...",
      "Thirsty? A butter-fingered food tourist dropped a nasty vial into the well trying to fill his canteen.",
      "He said it'd turn back soon... but I noticed he didn't drink any.",
      "And he left in a hurry. Though he kind of came in that way too.",
      "It's not too bad, really. Once you get used to the texture.",
      "Help yourself.",
      "Would you care for some refreshment?",
      "Bathtime has been interesting!",
      "But it's hard to wash blood off the stones.",
      "Not scared of a little blood are you?",
      "Who knows what that vial was...",
      "Don't be shy. Get on in there.",
      "This well's all the town's got left.",
      "Wonder if there's a way to revert the process...",
      "Fill your cask, if you like.",
      "Wish we had something better to offer.",
      "With that pallor, might be you prefer it this way.",
      "It does burn going down a bit. But sits cool in the gut.",
      "Could say the whole town's blood's up!",
      "This town was a beautiful oasis when I was a boy...",
      "Everyone thinks monsters dried up the wellspring.",
      "I don't think monsters had anything to do with it!",
      "No use for old farmers like me now in this ocean of sand.",
      "Maybe if you kill Rhyzik, people'll see the real problems around here.",
      "Some people can't see the forest for the trees...",
      "Folks always need someone to blame...",
      "When you live in a desert, gotta preserve your resources!",
      "When that well dries up, they can try wringin' water from a stone!",
      "What this place needs is a real leader.",
      "Feel free to chime in here...",
      "They think I'm complainin'. I'm the only one who sees it!",
      "We're all livin' on borrowed time!",
      "Time comes, won't even have the strength to dig my hole...",
      "Can't just magically restore what we've lost...",
      "Things are gonna get real ugly...",
      "Gonna have to put our heads together.",
      "What good's slayin' monsters if the well runs dry?",
      "Kalabor Oasis was the soul of this desert.",
      "All I'm saying is that we haven't tried offering Rhyzik sacrifices...",
      "People act like I'm crazy.",
      "It's not a radical idea!",
      "The practice's old as time itself.",
      "Entire civilizations were built on it!",
      "This guy knows what I'm talking about.",
      "Sometimes you have to make hard choices.",
      "Can you talk sense into him?",
      "Listen to this guy. Sacrifice to Rhyzik? That's insane!",
      "Lot of folks who fought to retake the northern outpost didn't come back.",
      "We've sacrificed plenty!",
      "Next refugee caravan leaves for the Weald tomorrow. And my girls'll be on it!",
      "The pass over the mountains isn't easy...",
      "But it's better than staying here.",
      "This place's not worth dying for.",
      "Don't you go taking his side.",
      "The odds are against us.",
      "Rhyzik's gonna raze this place to the ground.",
      "I just want to spend time with my books!",
      "What do they want from me? I'm no fighter!",
      "Got to a point where it was either walk out into the dunes...",
      "Or sit back here and have a good cry.",
      "I think I'm good now.",
      "Family's such a pain...",
      "Everyone thinks they know how to live my life...",
      "I don't need this town anyway.",
      "My problems probably seem small in comparison...",
      "You kind of cheered me up.",
      "You don't think so?",
      "Just need a little more time...",
      "You're a good listener...",
      "Nowhere to run to...",
      "I like to be alone.",
      "Wish I could fly away...",
      "Why're you giving me that look?",
      "We're all doomed anyway.",
      "Oh! Uh... Hi.",
      "Haven't seen you around here before.",
      "This town doesn't have much going on these days...",
      "Well, nothing good anyway.",
      "Spend most my time reading...",
      "With trade routes closed, not many new books coming in.",
      "Day 6\u00a0: Entry 1 - Time is running short before the White Orchids gather again. If I wish to join this august order of culinary adventurers, I need to find something worthy of their palate.",
      "Day 14\u00a0: Entry 2 - Last year I thought my wyvern filets would have been enough to earn my pin, but only one new member is admitted each year and I underestimated my competition... never in my wildest dreams did I expect someone to prepare a wheel of Roshan cheese.",
      "Day 22\u00a0: Entry 3 - This year though, I have a secret weapon... a trunk of seasoning from The Isle of Masks. If I find the right dish to pair these lost spices with, my membership is all but assured.",
      "Day 29\u00a0: Entry 4 - My expedition to the Howling Weald has so far been a failure. The conflict between the Bonemeal Ogres and Lucius Longclaw scared away most of the wildlife save for the hellbears... but perhaps that is enough to work with.",
      "Day 31\u00a0: Entry 5 - It seems dire wolves are too gamey to be used for elevated cuisine, but the quills are perfect to be fashioned into skewers for whatever protein will be featured.",
      "Day 32\u00a0: Entry 6 - Silkmire spider eggs are pleasingly tart. However, based on the amount of vomiting I did after eating some, I think it\u2019s best that I abandon dreams of using these to make a dessert.",
      "Day 35\u00a0: Entry 7 - With Silkmire behind me I turn to a temple long since forgotten. Perhaps a rare truffle waits to be found in a dead king's tomb, or maybe the poison from an old dart trap could be diluted and used in broth.",
      "Day 41\u00a0: Entry 8 - The temple did not prove as fertile as I had hoped. Stone bats, while a viable option for a kitschy pestle, are not particularly edible.",
      "Day 46\u00a0: Entry 9 - For three days I tracked a thunderhide alpha, but it was all for naught - a Marrowfell hunting party all had eyes on the great beast... and I know better than to quibble over poaching rights with a pack of angry centaurs.",
      "Day 57\u00a0: Entry 10 - Again I have been met with failure. With time running short before the competition, I must dig deep and find a new solution: Time to break out the wine.",
      "Day 66\u00a0: Entry 11 - Kalabor is a waste of what little time remains. If land is bearing no fruit, I must turn to the seas. If I can't find a worthy protein in the black waters surrounding Dark Reef, can I even call myself a gastromancer?",
      "The seafloor path to Dark Reef is too dangerous.",
      "Atop this snowy peak is buried a long-forgotten kingdom.",
      "It once bridged these cold lands and the rough waters below.",
      "Damn growlers raided the penguin ponds again. Soon they'll be knocking on our doors.",
      "It's about more than we can handle. Can you clear out some growlers and find those poor penguins?",
      "The main village is up the mountain. We don't get there much, what with the dragon...",
      "You found my wife's locket! She'd want you to keep it for now. To aid you in the trials to come.",
      "Can't catch any fish with so many growlers around. Stew pot's getting empty...",
      "Eyes off those penguins, bub.",
      "Don't stand so close to me.",
      "You mean you've met THE Rylai? The real Rylai?",
      "It's an honor, sirs.",
      "The shifting snows foretold your arrival.",
      "For too long we have been denied entrance to the halls of our ancestors.",
      "But you who come from burning lands shall finally melt the way!",
      "Beyond the the Iceblight Plateau lies the Frozen Crag and the passage that you seek.",
      "Outside the village the cold winds are deadly. Not allowed to go out by myself...",
      "Don't see why. It's safe if you stay by the signal fires.",
      "mrrrrowww",
      "gurrhr",
      "blep",
      "I'm trying to catch, what I'm told, is the most flavorful Azuran Pike.",
      "Alas! Perch, Trout, Bluegill... even a Crimson Octopus! Just no bloody Pike.",
      "All because I skimped on the binding for my journal!",
      "The White Orchids convene in a fortnight. I hope my flightless friends here can speed me down the mountain in time...",
      "The trappers keep me up to my eyeballs in hides.",
      "The only way to tame harsh lands is with cold steel.",
      "The shopkeepers sell some of my wares, if you're interested.",
      "We haven't had a shipment from Whitecap in weeks.",
      "I don't miss the menfolk much, but that Whitecap salmon...",
      "Now that you've cleared the way, it won't be long...",
      "You lot look like you could use a hot bowl of stew!",
      "It's my job to keep the fire lit.",
      "You don't last long in these parts without warmth.",
      "I wish the Ice Maiden had come with us from Icewrack...",
      "The Ice Maiden's sister? In these parts?",
      "She'd have known what to do about that dragon.",
      "You killed the icewyrm?",
      "Oh, you took care of it?",
      "Well I hope you didn't leave a mess behind.",
      "I can't wait to visit Whitecap Lake!",
      "You know, it's interesting that your heart is the icy one...",
      "This town was abandoned for a long time.",
      "It feels good to reclaim these old holdings.",
      "Cobalt was nice, but these are the lands of my ancestors.",
      "I once knew the way... Though the way is closed.",
      "The path behind might still lie ahead. One never knows.",
      "This I can tell you: stand upon that seal for a vision of the future.",
      "I've made my peace with the restless spirits in this forsaken hall. But they do not welcome you.",
      "To escape, you must unlock each of the four seals in the throne room.",
      "Stand on each seal long enough to lower the door. When all four have been unlocked, the path will open.",
      "The bells of the undead are sounding... make your escape!",
      "Hey, you! Over here...",
      "Sven?! Is that you?",
      "Tidehunter! Thought I'd never see you again.",
      "Impressive set of legs you've got there!",
      "Hey! Did I hear it right that you're a doctor?",
      "Hey, perk up, kid. Life ain't all bad.",
      "You! Yeah, you! Get over here. Now!",
      "Wow, that's some wicked sunburn!",
      "Hey, where you running off to?",
      "Commendable number of appendages you have there.",
      "Don't see too many friendly faces down here.",
      "Spend a lot of time blending in with my surroundings...",
      "Anyway, you sure you want to go that way?",
      "Getting really close to Dark Reef...",
      "Word on the currents says something bad--worse than usual--is going down in there.",
      "Don't get me wrong. Your business is your business.",
      "Just never seen anyone go into Dark Reef of their own accord...",
      "But I'm happy for the company!",
      "This place lacks quality conversationalists.",
      "I hear folks topside have lots of conversations. 'Round here? Nothing.",
      "Topside's not the best place for a guy like me, though.",
      "One time a guy up there tried to catch me.",
      "Put me in his boat and everything.",
      "Squeezed my way out the scupper and called it lesson learned!",
      "Folks've underestimated me all my life.",
      "Always said a cephalopod wouldn't amount to much.",
      "Even said I couldn't win the spelling bee.",
      "Well, e-u-d-a-e-m-o-n-i-c. Eudaemonic.",
      "That was my word.",
      "But I'll tell you what-- Oh, sorry, I interrupted. Go on?",
      "Well, if you've got to be on your way, I understand...",
      "Maybe I'll take up gardening.",
      "Or just gaze at the sun with my wandering eye...",
      "Anyway, see you around.",
      "Have you ever seen such a beautiful day?",
      "I got sent to Dark Reef when I was just a lil' guppy.",
      "Now that Siltbreaker's in charge, fish like me can finally get a fair shake!",
      "I never liked that Warden Grimwater.",
      "Head on in. For once, the water's perfect!",
      "Day 81\u00a0: Entry 12 - It would appear that I have stumbled upon some primitive tribe. I thought of trying to barter for some local spices, but as I approached their camp I saw them feasting on the corpse of a fur trader. The sooner I can find shelter the better.",
      "Day 85\u00a0: Entry 13 - I did not find shelter so much as shelter found me - the tribe I had previously wrote about spotted me and gave chase... were it not for a local's intervention I would certainly be dead. On the bright side, in addition to saving me, Ymir also told me where I can find some Ogre Seals.",
      "Day 90\u00a0: Entry 14 - Ahh the Frostwise Penguin... while some of my contemporaries swear that their eyes are a delicacy that every man should try once in their lives, I can't bring myself to kill a waddling creature of such majesty.",
      "Day 99\u00a0: Entry 15 - Brutal. Dangerous. And utterly delicious, the Ogre Seal is the perfect protein for my play on a fish taco. Now to find a decent town and get some proper seasoning.",
      "Day 106\u00a0: Entry 16 - Unlike my feelings on Penguins, I had no qualms with striking down that Alpine Growler. By grinding his fangs to meal, perhaps I could create a soft shell that will serve as a perfect vehicle for my main protein.",
      "Day 121\u00a0: Entry 17 - Success! I tested out my dish with some local performers, and they were so delighted that they invited me to hit the town with them. After all I have been through, a proper celebration is a welcome end to my journey. My membership within the White Orchids is all but assured.",
      "Day 122\u00a0: Entry\u00a0??? - I have failed in spectacular fashion. I spent so much focus on preparing a dish worthy of heroes, that I neglected to notice the binding on my journal has been torn. With no record of how I arrived to my final plating, the White Orchids will never accept me into their Order. So close to my final presentation, there's no way to backtrack in time to find all the missing pages... So now I sit - a half-frozen fool with a fishing pole. I've heard this lake has pike... I hate deboning pike.",
      "Log: 37d 118ty - Of all those Conclave cretins, Master Siltbreaker was the most despicable. But also the most enfeebled by his dryland heritage; I'd expected him to succumb to age within the year. Was that thing really him? It tore the honor guard to pieces...",
      "Log: 142d 118ty - Let Maelrawn take the Conclave. I warned against working with a council of impetuous half-bloods. Human greed makes them weak. What would their precious peace with the drylanders be worth if Siltbreaker had destroyed us all?",
      "Log: 156d 118ty - Master Roe swears the Conclave was deceived -- that Siltbreaker asked them to assist in a healing ritual. Does he take me for a child? I may not be versed in magics, but the Conclave's ill-advised ploys for power are well known to me.",
      "Log: 58d 136ty - I did not pass by his vault today. I may not go tomorrow. His presence no longer troubles me at night. I finally trust the binding runes to hold him, to keep the fragments of his mind scattered far away. At least in this, the Conclave's claims have held true.",
      "Log: 23d 159ty - Strange incidents of unrest these past few days, but not amongst the prisoners. The guards have grown quarrelsome with each other, and several have been found far from their posts, wandering the lower levels. None recall how they came to be there.",
      "Log: 32d 159ty - A gang of meranths killed two guards today. A patrol found them near Siltbreaker's vault. Unfortunately, the meranths didn't survive long enough for me to question them... Is it possible they knew the contents of the vault?",
      "Log: 95d 159ty - Something seems... different about the binding runes. Did the dream of a drowned scorpion hold some meaning after all?",
      "Log: 96d 159ty - Already the lower levels belong to him. Wherever the conclave sent Siltbreaker, he's more powerful even than before. The seas are lost.",
      "Log: 97d 159ty - I weep for the guards turned against us by Siltbreaker's magic. But those who join him willingly deserve no quarter. They still see the drylanders only as enemies. I once felt as they do, but the Conclave was right. The years of peace have been kind to us all.",
      "Log: 99d 159ty - The last of my guards have fallen... or been turned to Siltbreaker's cause. To stay means a grim fate. I might still seek refuge with the Deep Ones. We could perhaps get word out in time...",

      "In the deepest recess of Dark Reef prison, a dormant evil stirs\u2014the fiendish Siltbreaker\u2014waking to thoughts of freedom and a campaign of retribution to come. Only in the heart of the Kalabor Desert might we find the means to stop him... Our final chance to seize a shard of hope.",
      "As the fiend Siltbreaker plots an escape from Dark Reef prison, his enemies in the Conclave of the Brine assemble a band of warriors to take up arms against him. For the adventurers who answer the Conclave's call, the road to Dark Reef begins near the sands of Kalabor, where Siltbreaker's twisted creation, Rhyzik the Corruptor, gathers strength to aid his master's plans...",
      "Siltbreaker's escape attempt did not go unnoticed Rhyzik the Corruptor has resurfaced to aid his master's revival. Rhyzik has long eluded us \u2014 Destroy him before infiltrating Dark Reef. End these threats to the Conclave \u2014 Our ledger will be cleared of your name.",
      "With Rhyzik the Corruptor defeated and a measure of Siltbreaker's might destroyed, the first step of the Conclave's mission is complete. Free of Rhyzik's swarms, the people of Kalabor are free to return home or establish a new homeland amidst the pacified Weald.",
      "As the Conclave's defenders step through the wisp emissary\u2019s portal, an uncertain fate lies before them. They journey now to their true purpose: Infiltrate Dark Reef prison by any means necessary... And ensure Siltbreaker never leaves.",
      "A descent to the main gates of Dark Reef would mean certain death for a drylander. But there is a way that circumvents the crushing depths. The final journey to Siltbreaker's vault begins amidst the windswept snows of Bitter Ridge...",
      "The chosen of the Brine had seen their purpose through. The fiend Siltbreaker was no more. With their old enemy finally destroyed, and a good portion of the sea-bred\u2019s worst offenders gone with him, the Conclave could ensure the dryland armistice would hold, and perhaps even forge a true peace between the Mer and the lands above.",
      "For a time, Dark Reef prison would lie empty, save for those small creatures unconcerned with the suffering of the sentient. As for the chosen themselves... their debts to the Conclave absolved, the four wayward mercenaries were free to scatter once again into the wind. To meet again on another battlefield, perhaps as friend... or foe."

      "Slyrak is known for his ire.\nHowever,  Mars says that he lacks the temperament that the war god seeks in his mounts.",
      "However,  Mars says that he lacks the temperament that the war god seeks in his mounts.",
      "Like most dragons, Slyrak dislikes being used as a mount.",
      "Like his fellow Eldwurms, Slyrak possesses centuries worth of wisdom.",
      "Although he's mostly known for not being so discreet, Slyrak has an aspect of guile to him, as shown when he tricked Davion by exploiting his honor.",
      "Like a stereotypical dragon, Slyrak often hoards gold in his lair. Davion inherits this tendency as well.",
      "Slyrak's voice is just an altered version of Davion's own voice. This implies that Slyrak doesn't seem to have a voice of his own.",
      "This seems to imply that the eyeless and armored iron dragons are the ancestors of Slyrak's species.",
      "Reaching into the depths of Slyrak's blood's power allows Davion to draw strength from the oldest ancestral dragon strains, replacing Slyrak with an iron dragon.",
      "It's possible that Slyrak's different forms are actually different dragon species, classified by their scale color and breath attack. Seeing how they all have the same appearance even with the difference in color and powers, Slyrak and the dragon forms may belong to a common species. This is supported by the fact that Slyrak is not a unique specimen, since the lesser one of the two dark blue dragons mentioned in Thesos' logs resembled the body of Slyrak. Further supporting this is the power in Slyrak's blood that allows Davion to draw strength not just from a singular dragon but also from the oldest ancestral dragon strains, implying that his dragon blood gives him access to a vast and diverse lineage of Dragons that Slyrak belongs to.",
      "When meeting Sir Davion,  Morphling will compare himself to the former, saying that the both of them are \"always changing\". He may be referring to Davion's transformative power and how it's not limited to just one form of dragon, just like Morphling's unlimited forms. This may further explain the various forms and powers that Slyrak might have when he springs forth from Davion.",
      "Slyrak is one of the few known Eldwurms, a race of wise and powerful dragons. He is best known for merging his being with Davion by spilling both of their blood and allowing them to mingle, channeling his gifts through the Blood Route and into Davion.",
      "Many centuries ago, in the white and frigid lands of the north, this Frozen Witch Yulsaria ruled, summoning blizzards and hail storms upon those who displeased her. Commanding her armies of Ice Golems who snuffed out all warmth, she pushed southwards to expand her territory through conquest. Angered by her ambitions, Slyrak rose and melted this golem army with his fire breath. He then continued northward, burning away at Yulsaria's empire until it was destroyed.",
      "Although not explicit, the third missing dragon featured in this entry of the Archronicus is heavily implied to be Slyrak. It's uncertain if this incident happened after his fusion with the Dragon Knight known as Davion before that, but the former is more likely.",
      "This incident involved two dead dragons: one big and one small\u2014the latter of which was stated to be nowhere near fully grown akin to a wyrmling\u2014dark blue in colour and both slain by immolation, evident in their charred corpses. Their corpses were found at the edge of the grain stock lands, owned by a grain farmer. Around the corpses of these dragons were the footprints of a larger beast, whose marks on the soil were large enough for a full grown Keen to lie down in. The trail of prints ended at the edge of the field, implying that the creature took flight there. Responding to the rumour that reached the High Bell about the pair of dead dragons, the Keen Thesos arrived at the scene and speculated that this was the doing of a grand dragon from the stories of old, who is said to still live in the southerly wastes.",
      "With the good faith of his father's name and his promise of immediate removal, Thesos purchased the rotting corpse of the lesser dragon and hauled it behind his zonkey to bring it to his father's lands where he will study it. After several hours, he arrived at his destination with the dead dragon, ready to be examined. He spent several days disarticulating and boiling the corpse and spent a full night subjecting the bones to wax inurement. At last, the skeleton was ready for him to study in the great hall.",
      "Thesos drew his observations with careful ink, noting the size and shape of each bone. He was surprised by the structure of its wing and the architecture of its shoulder. He discovered that the dragon bones were very light despite being very tough, and more like the bones of a bird rather than a creature with scales and teeth. It is interesting to note that this dragon skeleton resembles the form of Slyrak himself, implying that this dragon and Slyrak belonged to the same species.",
      "However, the dragon's skeleton was not the main curiosity. Much to his surprise, Thesos found the fragments of an old shield in its insides. It intrigued him because dragons are known for carrying steel in their gullet to help gnash and grind their food for digestion. A dragon's gullet is also where they originate their flame breath so it perplexed him that they would also store steel or any similar material in the organ where their fire is generated. But what truly surprised him was the shield fragments. Piecing them together, these fragments formed a shield that bears a dragon crest, the seal of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian\u2014an ancient and obscure knighthood that's seen only rarely in these parts today.",
      "Slyrak is an Eldwurm, a wise and elderly dragon. Like his fellow sage dragons, he possesses great wisdom that he has accumulated over many centuries.",
      "It's implied that the ancient iron dragon species is an ancestor of Slyrak's species, thus Slyrak is a descendant of them.",
      "In Dota Underlords, Davion was enraged when he recovered from Anessix's power of enthrallment, which forced him to slay a bunch of dragons. As Slyrak, the dragon rallied his fellow dragon allies (seemingly composed of a thunder of black dragons) to exact retribution on the demon and avenge the fallen dragons.",
      "Contradicting his act of rallying dragons to his side to fight a common enemy, Slyrak has also killed two of his own kin. He may have done this out of self-defense, hinting that dragons don't always get along with each other.",
      "Winter Wyvern knew Slyrak long before he merged with Davion. When meeting the latter, Auroth will remind him that he's nothing like this Slyrak that she knew. She also states that he did something wrong before, and now its consequences are catching up to him. Whether she is talking to Davion or Slyrak or perhaps the both of them is unknown.",
      "Long before he became the  Dragon Knight, Knight Davion spent years pursuing and hunting Slyrak. Following his fateful fusion with Slyrak, he realized from that experience that a deal with a dragon is dangerous, and that one must only commit to a dragon's deal if they are prepared to keep their end of the transaction.",
      "His infusion with Slyrak gave him the abilities of the legendary Eldwurm himself. The source of his draconic powers, Slyrak's  Dragon Blood now flows through his veins, imbuing him with twice the vitality of an ordinary knight. Plus, Slyrak's blood is also what allows Davion to take on his dreaded  Elder Dragon Form and other dragon forms, thanks to its versatile, transformative powers that allow him to draw strength from more than just a single dragon. He also inherited Slyrak's power to  Breathe Fire.  Dragon Tail's description states that his dragon talents are combined with his knightly skills, making him a vicious opponent in melee combat.",
      "Now an ageless Knight thanks to the confluence with Slyrak, Davion's valor is fused with the wisdom of the Eldwurms and together they are the source of his nobility. This fusion of the Eldwurms' wisdom imbues him with their knowledge that they have accumulated over the centuries; as such, he now possesses powers and skills that are said to be beyond mortal knowledge.",
      "The suit of armour that Davion wears is that of a dragon's. Seeing how most of Davion's equipment is dragon-forged, it could be safe to assume that this armor is forged from Slyrak. Within this dragon's armor, Slyrak lies slumbering until he's called by Davion. When Slyrak is in the world, Davion remains within him. He warns against waking the both of them in any of these two states, which may bring unknown but unpleasant consequences. The armor does not seem to be static, because it can become stronger. It's possible that the dragon armor is a living armor because it can be restored by  Regeneration runes (although it may refer to the actual scales of Slyrak, not his dragon armor scales). Some of the gold that Davion collects is melted down for armor, possibly used to decorate it.",
      "Just like his armour, his shield is made from the scales of Slyrak. With all of this dragon-forged equipment, it's quite possible that his sword Wyrmblade is also dragon-forged and sourced from Slyrak. The shield that Thesos found in the guts of a dragon looks to be the same as Davion's shield. This shield bears a dragon crest, which is the seal of an ancient order called the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. Seeing how this shield comes from Slyrak, this Eldwurm might have a relationship to the knighthood. Alongside his shield, Davion swears upon and invokes his sword Wyrmblade during battle.",
      "When Davion dies in battle, he will blame Slyrak for failing him. He may also plea to be buried on the shield of Slyrak. Lastly, he will mention that his scales have fallen away when he dies. It's unknown if this refers to scale-rot or if the scales of his dragon armor have fallen off.",
      "A creature who is over millions of years old,  Puck sees the ancient Slyrak as a juvenile dragon. In Dota Underlords, it seems to be curious about Slyrak hiding inside Davion and it is interested in meeting him in the flesh. Puck may inquire Davion about his \u201ccondition\u201d which might be referring to Slyrak inhabiting his body. It seems that Puck wishes to meet him so that they may \u201cplay\u201d together. As a hostile, Puck threatens to rip out the Eldwurm from his vessel to fulfill its intentions with him.",
      "Siltbreaker is impressed by Slyrak and perhaps his power. The fact that he's impressed by him but not the Nothl Realm says a lot about the Eldwurm.",
      "Void Spirit has respect for the power of Slyrak.",
      "Fearing what could happen if nearby Dragons ever took a vested interest in White Spire,  Anessix compelled Davion with her mind control to kill a bunch of dragons. Her control wore off and Davion returned to his senses, enraged by the demon's actions. To avenge the slain dragons, he turned into Slyrak and rallied his dragon allies to punish Anessix.",
      "In Dota Underlords,  Lich seeks to kill Slyrak. Interestingly, Lich also did something wrong to Auroth, implying that he's hostile to the Eldwurms for some reason.",
      "Yulsaria roused the anger of Slyrak when he eventually heard of her southward expansion. In response, he destroyed her and her armies with his endless flame.",
      "It is implied that Slyrak lives around the southern part of the world. According to Thesos, there are old stories about a grand dragon that some say still lives in the southerly wastes. He connected these old stories with the evidence of a grand dragon's presence that he found in the scene of a dragon attack on two lesser dragons on a grain farmer's field. The evidence included the charred bodies of the 2 dragons, which was surrounded by huge footprints that ended at the edge of the field, implying flight and thus an Eldwurm who's heavily implied to be Slyrak. This is supported by the fact that Yulsaria's southward expansion from the cold north provoked Slyrak, implying that she was headed towards his domain.",
      "The picture on the right is Thesos' drawing of a skeleton of an adolescent dragon that he found dead in a grain farmer's lands. This dragon had dark-blue scales, just like the bigger dragon that was also found dead beside it. Obviously, this is not Slyrak himself, but what they both have in common is the identical shape of their bodies. From the skull to the tail, this young dragon's skeleton looks awfully similar to Slyrak's form; as such it can be used to tell Slyrak's internal morphology. There may be some differences in their forms because of the age and size difference between this relatively small wyrmling and the Eldwurm Slyrak, though.",
      "In Thesos' observations, he noted that the bones of this young dragon are very strong yet lightweight. He compared this dragon's bones to the bones of a bird rather than a \"creature with scales and teeth\". Perhaps Slyrak's own bones might be heavier than this dragon's, or not.",
      "Just like most dragons, this young dragon had an organ called a gullet. This gullet is where a dragon generates its flame breath (or ice breath in some dragon species) but it's also where they gnash and grind their foods using the hard material that they consume and keep in there, such as steel and iron, before digesting it. It's implied that this dragon had a large and tough gullet because somehow it was able to swallow into its own stomach what appears to be the Shield of Slyrak itself. Said shield was found broken in the young dragon's stomach, suggesting that its gullet was strong enough to grind metal. Slyrak may have had all this too, with a few differences given his size and power.",
      "Also, a Dragon's remains (such as a  Dragon Scale) still retain the powers and properties that it had in life, therefore making it more valuable than the wealth of the most prodigious dragon hoard. As such, Davion's armor and shield is made from the scales of Slyrak himself. An example of dragon remains retaining their properties is the blood of grand dragon Vyxia, which is hot enough to heat metal and it still retains its heat even after her implied death. Fiery blood may be a general characteristic among dragons, including Slyrak, since the fermented concentrate of a generic dragon's blood is also used to brew strong and spicy elixirs, further implying that their blood is fiery.",
      "Another general characteristic that he may have had is volatile and explosive saliva, something that's found in other fire-breathing dragons. This is uncertain, though.",
      "In his last moments living in a pure but frail form, Slyrak had the ability to speak directly into the minds of others. He used it to slip his whispered voice inside of Davion's thoughts and pleaded the knight to honor him with death in combat. In layman's terms, he is a telepath.",
      "Slyrak's immortality is based on his ability to reincarnate in another body. Allowing himself to bleed at the hands of his killer and shedding his slayer's blood too, Slyrak gave his power out along the Blood Route where his blood and Davion's blood mingled, imbuing the latter with all of the Eldwurm's strength and centuries of wisdom. The Dragon's death sealed their bond and the both of them were reborn. A rogue aspect of Spectre states that Slyrak will live again even after Davion's death, possibly referring to his reincarnation.",
      "Like most dragons, Slyrak has the ability to  Breathe Fire. In life, he has burned many other knights to a crisp, destroyed the icy empire of Yulsaria and might've incinerated two dark blue dragons\u2014one big and one small, the latter of which resembled his form\u2014on a grain farmer's property.",
      "Slyrak's  Dragon Tail is a powerful bodily weapon. His tail is tipped with a flat kite-shaped tail lined with three small horizontal spikes on both sides.",
      "Along the Blood Route, Slyrak transfused his  Dragon Blood to Davion, transferring all of his strength and wisdom. His lifeblood also grants Davion twice the vitality of an ordinary knight, regeneration, and transformative power that allows him to turn into a dragon. For a chosen few who have received dragon blood, the magic runs unusually thick, its effects are magnified and distorted. In these rare recipients, the reach of the transformation is extended, drawing strength from beyond a singular dragon, and reaching way back into the oldest ancestral strains of dragon, such as eyeless armored dragons that once terrorized whole kingdoms and raged wars across the countryside.",
      "No longer in his own pure body, Slyrak's existence in this plane now depends on Davion manifesting him through his  Elder Dragon Form. Besides his legendary breath of fire and his crimson scales, Slyrak can also appear with green scales and an acidic spit or blue scales and a freezing breath. Once he acquires  Aghanim's Scepter, he can now appear with sable scales akin to the black dragon species, and his projectile breath becomes a dark orb. Its description says that Davion's and Slyrak's powers combine when the latter springs forth."

Angered by this betrayal, Gondar tracked down the traitor, and killed him. He then claimed the second disciple's blade, as well as his veil, enchanted with one of Soruq's sigils. From this veil, Gondar learned of a rare and useful technique passed down from his old master, although the nature of that technique is unknown."

The ancestral spirits gave the Claddish Navy a fighting chance, but may have disturbed the abyssal god Maelrawn, who appeared and destroyed both fleets in a storm. One of the ancestral spirits summoned by the Suicide-Mages may have found its way into Tidebringer, Kunkka's legendary sword, where it imbued the weapon with unique powers.",

      "Akin to most dragons, Uldorak hoards precious stuff that never belonged to him in the first place. Sourced from the reluctant tribute of Candoness, the hoard of Uldorak should be composed of loads of gold and magic trinkets that he accumulated for at most thirteen generations of the Candonite royal family.",
      "Also like most dragons, Uldorak is cruel and lordly. Auroth states that one of the blights inflicted upon mortals by dragons is enslaving them, which is what he did to Candoness.",
      "His lordliness implies arrogance and thus he can be consumed by it. Generations of being spoiled by this realm of Candoness has led to his downfall, as he was accustomed to their subservience and didn't expect to be ambushed by Sir Davion on the day that should've been his usual collection of tribute.",
      "Uldorak's likeness on the Wyrm Helm of Uldorak might have served as a reference for the designs of his Dragon's Blood counterpart and the earth dragons. The Earth Eldwurm and his children inherited the original Uldorak's pair of forward-facing horns and his green eyes.\nThis version of Uldorak from Dota: Dragon's Blood was also a Time-Dragon, albeit according to Ashley Miller, 'twas only a title made by his publicist that had nothing to do with time itself, but rather a way to express how ancient he is. Complimenting his Time-Dragon title is the big clock that he wore around his neck.",

Complimenting his Time-Dragon title is the big clock that he wore around his neck.",
      "The Time-Dragon Uldorak was a character in the lore of Dota 2.",
      "Long ago, the dreaded presence of this Time-Dragon Uldorak fell upon the kingdom of Candoness. His appearance coincided with each passing of the Candonite Crown to a new king appearing with the intent of demanding and collecting tribute in the form of Gold and magic trinkets. Uldorak's tyranny and reign of terror spanned for many generations of the royal family of Candoness, until Dowager Queen Tansis XII made the fateful decision of summoning Sir Davion (who has yet to meet Slyrak) to slay their oppressor.",
      "Queen Tansis XII summoned Sir Davion to ambush Uldorak on the coronation day of her son Prince Tansis XIII. As usual, the oblivious and pampered Dragon appeared on her son's day of coronation, expecting no plots from the cowed people of Candoness. The Time-Dragon was ambushed by Sir Davion and they engaged in a fearsome duel that would determine the fate of the future generations of Candoness. The details of the surprise attack is unknown, but Sir Davion managed to kill Uldorak.",
      "With Uldorak's life out of the way, the relieved Tansis XIII was crowned as king and had the Wyrm Helm of Uldorak forged for Davion as a gift and reward.",
      "Uldorak was drawn to that Kingdom of Candoness, possibly to collect stuff for his hoard. There, he would subjugate her people to his tyranny, appearing on every day of coronation to demand tributes in the form of Gold and magic trinkets. It would seem that he oppressed and terrorized at most thirteen generations of the Kings of Candoness, as his reign of terror ended shortly before Tansis XIII was crowned king, thanks to Dowager Queen Tansis XII's decision to summon Sir Davion to slay Uldorak.",
      "Summoned by Dowager Queen Tansis XII, Sir Davion the  Dragon Knight is the brave slayer of Time-Dragon Uldorak, many years before the legendary confluence with the Eldwurm Slyrak. On the coronation day of Tansis XIII, Davion carried a shield that bore the crest of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian on the day he did battle with Uldorak. Following his victory, he had a helm that was possibly forged with the likeness of Uldorak himself, gifted to him by the relieved and newly-crowned King Tansis XIII. He also had Uldorak's crest horns fixed on his new pauldrons. Sir Davion may have used the Named Sword known as Dragonmaw to slay him.",
      "Based on the name of the set that is the only mention of his lore, Uldorak's remains might have been forged into armor, just like the rest of the dragons slain by Davion.",
      "It's unknown if \"Time-Dragon\" was a title unique to Uldorak or an actual species of dragon. It's also unknown if his name implied any association with time.",
      "Little is known about his physical appearance. Based on the helm that may or may not have his likeness, Uldorak might have had two forward-facing horns, red scales or dragon's hide, some sort of sharp beak, and green eyes. He had at least two \"crest horns\" as well, possibly located on the top of his skull."

The result was the lodestone's magnetism pulling nearby armored soldiers towards it, destroying the poorly built defenses and restraining the poor troops caught in it. They also have access to what appears to be a primitive tank or siege engine.",

      "The Dezun Order is a faction in the world of Dota 2.",
      "The Dezun Order is a congregation of faithful people dedicated to the Nothl Realm and its unnamed deities. Little is known about the order's purpose and goals due to their obscure and secretive nature, but much can be said about their customs and beliefs.",
      "Devoted to a culture that revolves entirely around the Nothl Realm with its inverted versions of dark and light, members of the order are known to take shady vows, for they believed that there is good in darkness instead of the light.",
      "All members of the order have a deep respect for their late members. Almost none of their material possessions seem to be made but rather passed down from long-dead fellows. The Shadow Priests honor their hallowed predecessors by equipping their sacred fetishes to preserve them, while the warriors of the Order hold dearly the remains of their sacrificed warriors who came before them crafting their bones into weapons and armor to carry their remains into the fields of battle once more.",
      "The Shadow Priest congregation is the gateway into the Dezun Order's arcane and esoteric culture. Once a chosen person is admitted into the ranks of these priests, they will become an acolyte who must now complete a series of rites to qualify as a true Shadow Priest. The number, names, and purposes of these rites are unknown, but only one of them is known by name and purpose: the Rite of Shades. This final rite of passage involves a spiritual journey into the Nothl Realm for the purpose of gaining the strange powers that would make them a Shadow Priest. However, this result is not always realized, because there is a chance for the visitor to never return to the lands of the living. Of those who do, they may return mad or return with Nothlic power that marks the success of their dark initiation. As the holy people of the Order, they practice sacraments and may be canonized to become even holier. ",
      "Sacrifice is a very common ritual in the Dezun Order. Conducted by the Shadow Priests, the Order sacrifices the spirits of their warriors (usually with their consent and enthusiasm) or enemies (whether they like it or not) into the Nothl Realm to please the gods that dwell in the Nothl. Regardless of whoever gets sacrificed, their deaths will grant them great honors in the Nothl and are always ennobling to the order.",
      "These rites and enchantments (note how they are not called \"spells\" but still work like them) are often used among the ranks of the Dezun Order, whether they're a Shadow Priest or a Sacred Warrior.",
      "Poison Touch is just one among the few Dezun rituals meant for offensive purposes. The ritual releases a poison that paralyzes anyone unfortunate enough to catch it.",
      "A minor enchantment known to the Dezun priests and anyone they impart it to,  Inner Vitality unlocks the innate regenerative powers of its recipient through their most prominent traits: strength, agility, or intelligence. As the magic draws upon only one of these three attributes to work its regeneration, the patient is technically being healed by themselves. Dazzle and the Dezun priests taught this enchantment to Huskar, who now reserves its use in times of great injury only.",
      "According to Dazzle, resurrection comes easily to the Priests of Shadow. This is proven by his  Shallow Grave spell and his feat where Dazzle cast a deep incantation on Huskar to reprieve him from being sacrificed into the Nothl Realm.",
      "Clothes that are woven in complete darkness can channel the essence of the Nothl Realm into its weave. Because of this magic, it's believed that the garments' enchantments will grow stronger as it ages. These holy garments are revered for their hallowed creators and catalysts of heightened Nothlic power.",
      "Troll teeth are used as vessels for the souls of their former owners. These teeth are carefully assembled into a necklace.",
      "The Father Spirit may dwell in the sacred clothing of the Dezun Order such as their sleeves. The inner spirit grants the inanimate object its status as a dazzling fetish.",
      "The Dezun Order is led by a council of elders who make all of the decisions, give sanctions, and honor its most outstanding members. They once sought to expand the Order's influence on a campaign that involved exploiting Huskar's newfound powers as their tool, but their upset sacred warrior left the Order and his ancestral home before they could even implement their plans.",
      "Shadow Priests and acolytes of the Shadow constitute the ranks of Dezun. They undergo ordinations from their Order with unknown purposes. The Order can also reordain them and give new orders. These priests take shady vows and may renew them. In some unpleasant occassions, these priests may be excommunicated or executed for unknown reasons. As the Order's holy men, they conduct all of its rituals.",
      "Alongside Dezun's priests, the Order also has ranks of sacred warriors who fight their bloody battles for them. They are often sacrificed by the Shadow Priests in Nothlic rituals.",
      "Dazzle is but one of the many Shadow Priests of Dezun, but what makes him so strikingly different is his powers over the dualities of light and dark, mending and destruction. Not only that, but he gained his power as a young acolyte despite being too young for the Rite of Shades, a testimony to his prodigal skill.",
      "Huskar is a sacred warrior who was about to be sacrificed to the Nothl Realm, but was reprieved against the ancient rites of Dezun when his cousin Dazzle withdrew him from the Nothl with a deep incantation. Like all who return from the Nothl, he was gifted with inverted powers\u2014in his case it was the ability to grow exponentially stronger every time he lost his infinite lifeforce.",

When he drank Davion's blood, he began screaming out of pain from his transformation and recalled visions of a lifeless ember dragons and his research on them\u2014possibly correlated to the donor who happens to be an ember dragon type. Emanating smoke from his body, he grew a bit larger and began to manifest sharp teeth, red scales, and eyes like that of an ember dragon's. The process cured his left hand, but its effects wore off and he returned to his normal body, but this time, he was weakened. Father appeared to be on the verge of dying if he did not consume more of that stuff.",
      "It's possible that all of this happened because Father tampered with the blood, seeing how he mentioned earlier that he transformed the blood. Or perhaps it had nothing to do with that and its harmful effects to non-dragons would happen anyway.",
      "After studying  Davion's \"curse\" through Kaden's experience with its capabilities, as well as performing bloody and painful experiments on Davion, Father speculated that Davion is a member of the Dragon Clan. He believed it to be so because Davion's power is similar to that of a Dragon Clan member's power. He also states that Davion and Slyrak are one and the same and they are permanently bonded together. Slyrak confirms this former statement when he explains that he and Davion are at one with each other. He shares this connection to Slyrak with Lina, another person who is an aspect of Slyrak as well.",
      "Father states that  Lina possesses features of an ember dragon, adding that the draconic side of her being makes up most of it than her human side. This is confirmed when Slyrak reveals to her that, in his point of view, she isn't a distinct individual but rather a part of the whole that is him\u2014naught but a tiny extension of his embodiment, including his spirit. To those who are also derived from Slyrak, she feels a strong relationship with these people, such as Davion.",
      "According to Father, Rylai the  Crystal Maiden possesses some features of a water dragon. This dragon heritage is the source of her ice powers.",
      "Knowledge and beliefs about Dragon Clan is considered to be heretical among the Dragon Knights order. Despite this, Father has books about this ancient faction of draconic people. He knows quite a lot about the faction and may have secretly studied the clan's capabilities to enhance his Order's power and finally cure the injury on his left hand that rendered him unfit to fight or wield any sort of dragonslaying weapon. Rylai is one of the few people who knows his belief in Dragon Clan, which led to her meeting Kaden.",
      "Speaking of Kaden, he may have some knowledge of the Dragon Clan. He somehow knew that Davion was possessed by Slyrak and called the condition a \"curse\", not knowing the true nature of Davion.",
      "Dragon's Clan relationship with the dragons goes far beyond their flesh and blood. Because they're the cousins of a certain dragon type, and dragons are the physical body parts of an Eldwurm, they are also the aspects of their respective Eldwurm's embodiment. Unlike their Dragon cousins, however, members of Dragon Clan have a spirit and a mind, but these stuffs do not belong to them, these essences belong to their respective Eldwurms. All in all, they are smaller parts of an Eldwurm's body, soul, and mind.",
      "An example of this connection is Lina and Slyrak. Lina is a part of Slyrak's vast embodiment because she has a part of the latter's vast spirit\u2014the \"ember soul\" as Slyrak calls it. Her soul, the very essence of the fire element, and her mind actually belongs to Slyrak, yet she has her own will separate from him."

      "It's implied that Vyxia is an eldwyrm because of her \"grand dragon\" title, a title that was also used to refer to another dragon of large proportions who's implied to be Slyrak himself, judging by the evidence. Seeing how all that remains of Vyxia is a sword in Sir Davion's possession that's made from her scales, teeth, and fiery blood, she is most likely dead.",
      "It seems that the  Lich is ill-disposed to the two remaining Eldwurms. He seeks to battle and perhaps kill Slyrak and he has done something wrong to Auroth that has shocked the Netherdrake  Viper, implying some sort of backstabbery. His wrongdoing against Auroth may have taken place after he warmed up to her in Artifact."

      "The Scaled Knights of Uthorian are an ancient and obscure order of dragon knights in the lore of Dota 2.",
      "Judging by the name, the knights of this order are characterized by scales, dragon scale in particular when one considers the context surrounding the few mentions of this knighthood. One of the order's renowned members, Sir Davion, wears a suit of dragon-armor and wields a dragon-scale shield that are both made from Slyrak himself, implying that his fellow knights also wear suits of armor made from a dragon's scales and carry dragon-forged equipment just like him. This is why they're called the \"scaled knights\" which is a fancier word for a dragon knight. It's currently unknown who or what this \"Uthorian\" entity is.",
      "To the right is Thesos' drawing of a broken shield that he found in a young dragon's insides. Once he pieced it together, Thesos recognized this shield and the Dragon crest that is emblazoned on it: a knight's shield with the seal of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. The shield resembles the one that Sir Davion wields by default which he states is the dragon scale shield of Slyrak. Since the shield of Slyrak looks like this sundered shield, the dragon's crest of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian might be depicting Slyrak himself, thus they are represented by Slyrak.",
      "Contradicting this is the appearance of the same dragon crest (albeit in a lighter color of red) in another shield that Davion carried to battle against Time-Dragon Uldorak long before he had the shield of Slyrak. This implies that the dragon symbol does not depict Slyrak so much as a generic dragon crest. Although it's possible that the crimson version of this crest on the shield of Slyrak is unique to said shield only (and it still depicts Slyrak) in order to differentiate it from other shields or objects of the order that also bear this seal.",
      "Their dragon crest is also displayed on their banners, such as the ones in Davion's camp to the left picture. Aside from these banners, they also have a recurring dragon's motif in their property, such as the dragon head bow on Davion's wooden boat. The recurring dragon motif possibly symbolizes the order's dedication to their dragon-based occupation.",
      "According to Thesos, this ancient knight's order can be seen (albeit rarely) around the lands owned by Thesos' father in the present age. Their presence was indicated by a broken shield of Uthorian that he found in the guts of a dead young dragon. The business that they have in those lands are unknown, but the unknown knight who owned that shield may have been there to hunt the local dragons in the area.",
      "According to the  Tome of Knowledge, dragon knights never charge for their services.",
      "A dragon knight can only be successful in battle against dragons if they have mastered themselves. Only then can they achieve mastery against dragons as well.",
      "To a dragon knight, mastery of the self includes valor, strong faith in one's abilities, and a sharp mind even during the chaos of battle.",
      "Between their sword and shield, the latter is more important because dragons always strike first, which is almost a guaranteed death. Those who follow this boast few scars.",
      "Like most knighthoods, the aspect of honor is a trademark among the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. Knights are expected to live and die with their honor intact.",
      "For the Scaled Knights, there is no honor to be gained in slaying dragons who are unable to fight back. There are some exemptions to this, such as mercy killing.",
      "Dragons slain by them in battle are posthumously honored via forging their remains into battle equipment, which are marks of distinction for the knight who earned it.",
      "Little is known about the structure and hierarchy (assuming they have one) of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. Not even their head count is known, save for one member of this order.",
      "Dragon Knight is heavily implied to be a knight of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian. As shown above, his belongings and equipment bears their distinguished dragon's crest. Despite having the lifeblood of his order's enemy, he still carries their crest in his camp and gear. It's possible he was exiled from his knighthood for his condition, hence his loneliness.",
      "Dawnbreaker is curious about the reaction of Sir Davion's fellow knights to his failure in killing Slyrak and the ironic fusion that happened after.",
      "Slyrak was one of the named dragons hunted by the Scaled Knights, the sole knight dispatched to kill him being Sir Davion. He was hunted for years for unknown reasons.",

Assassins are taught to meditate, enhancing their abilities to anticipate incoming attacks. Through divine will, Phantom Assassins can deal decisive blows, often ending a mark's life in one stroke. The weapons of the Phantom Assassins range from long, nimble blades to heavier, curved ones. Above all, the Veiled Sisters pride themselves on weapons that can pierce anything.",

      "Iron dragons are an ancient species of dragon in the lore of Dota 2.",
      "An Iron Dragon's form seems to be proof that dragon morphology has hardly changed throughout the species' aeons of evolution. It has the standard form of a dragon, which includes a total of six limbs (two arms and two legs in a quadrupedal stance, plus a pair of big wings) and a kite-shaped tail. Both of its hands had four digits that are composed of three fingers, and one thumb, plus their feet had only three toes. Most of these features can still be seen in modern dragons, such as Slyrak, Jakiro, and the black dragons.",
      "Their most notable features are their metallic scales that act as natural armor and an apparent lack of eyes due to said scales apparently covering them. Rather than a typical Dragon's small scales, an iron dragon's scales were more alike to large, overlapping plate armor. These plate-scales were mostly dorsal\u2014the plated scales ran along their back (also covering the top of their forearms and the upper side of their wings' forelimbs and elongated digits, as well as the tips on each digit of their wings, but not the membrane between them) until their plated scales terminated at the tail, forming a pointy arrow-shaped scale that covered its similarly shaped tail. The scales also fully covered the dragon's head and mandible, making it blind (assuming that it has eyes under the plates). Its fingers are also covered in these plate-scales. The only ventral plate that it has is the single breastplate on its chest.",
      "It's unknown if iron dragons are fire breathing dragons. If they did breathe fire, then they should have an organ called a gullet where they originated their fiery breath as well as gnash and grind swallowed food with iron, steel or other hard gullet material. It's also unknown if they still shared other common characteristics with modern dragons such as fiery blood in their veins, tough but light bones akin to a bird's bones, volatile and explosive drool, etc.",
      "In the lore of Dota 2, a dragon's scales are often used to forge metallic armor such as the ones worn by Davion. Scales being turned into metal may not make sense, but the existence of an ancestral dragon species known as the Iron Dragons says otherwise.",
      "It is possible that the Iron Dragons are the answer on why a dragon's scales can be forged into metal stuff. Long ago, dragons in the past were once covered in scales of pure metal, but over aeons of evolution, the metallic properties of these scales were diminished but not removed. Today's dragons appear to have none of their ancestor's metal in their scales, but the traces of their scales' metallic glory still remained. Hence, iron dragon scales are the reason why stuff forged from dragon scales turn out to be metallic.",
      "Slyrak (and the unnamed species of dragons he belongs to) might be a descendant of the Iron Dragons. The Immortal's title \"Kindred of the Iron Dragon\" should be a clear indicator of this, plus its lore goes further into this detail.",
      "It's stated that in the chosen few who are imbued with dragon's blood, such as Sir Davion with Slyrak's blood, its magic runs unusually thick and its effects are enhanced and distorted. Thus the blood's transformative powers (Slyrak's blood and its powers in particular) are enhanced, allowing the recipient to draw strength beyond a single dragon and from the oldest ancestral dragon strains, such as the iron dragons of yore.",
      "The takeaway is that iron dragons are described as an ancestral strain, meaning that other dragon species evolved from this ancestor. If Slyrak's blood can tap into the ancestral strain of the iron dragons, then should be related to them by blood. Furthermore, Slyrak and his own species should be their descendants if this is the case.",
      "As stated above, the transformative powers in Slyrak's blood allows the  Dragon Knight to transform into an iron dragon.",
      "In a forgotten age when they still thrived, the iron dragons once terrorized entire kingdoms and raged wars across the countryside."

On its hind legs though, it also has two front toes, but the points of its hocks have a claw sticking out of it, which possibly used to be its hind toe. This implies that it had avian features, much like most dragons. The hump over its shoulders and neck means that it has tall extensions on top of its cervical vertebrae, akin to the humps seen on bisons. It has a small horn on top of its black nose. Running along the crest is a mane akin to a horse's, plus it has a goatee beard and facial hair somewhat akin to mutton chops or sideburns.",

As such, it appears to be depressed. His locuthi is one of the necessary elements of survival in his crusade across his former desert home.

Because of its durability, their skin is sometimes fashioned into leather armor that is resistant to bladed weapons. Beyond the head of a Thunderhide are its two bony frills: the front frill that covers the neck and the back frill which covers a portion of their back area. Striking behind the frill that covers the neck can kill it. Young thunderhides appear to lack this natural armor, making them vulnerable.

Gorod in the frigid realm of Icewrack. Another ice wyvern named Karaul Silverwing turned the waypoint between Azura and Whitecap into her nesting ground.",
      "Instead of a typical dragon's total of six limbs (2 arms and 2 legs and a pair of wings), a wyvern has a total of four limbs, consisting of a pair of wings as their sole forelimbs and a pair of legs, very much like a bird or a bat or even a pterosaur.",
      "According to Thesos, a dragon skeleton's bones are strong but light, and seem to be more akin to a bird's bones. This seems to suggest an interesting link between Dragons (perhaps including wyverns) and avian creatures.",
      "Like most dragons, if not all of them, a wyvern stokes their flame breath in their gullet. This is the same organ where they store their swallowed foods, which is gnashed and grinded by the steel or other hard materials that they keep in there. In some wyverns who breathe ice instead of fire, their frosty gullets produce a cold breath that sends victims into a \"burning agony\"\u2014a paradoxical combination of 2 incompatible elements. An ice wyvern's frozen gullet also has specialized vesicles that slowly produce ice shards for them to launch towards enemies as a projectile attack. As for their fiery counterparts, perhaps their gullets have flameglands (instead of ice-producing vesicles) that generates their fire breath.",
      "It's implied that a wyvern's gullet is somewhere beneath the hide of its breast.",
      "Wyverns may have some of a dragon's usual characteristics, such as having remains that still retain their powers and properties, even in Death: including fiery scales, their hot blood,  and volatile dragon drool. The fiery blood and explosive saliva may not apply to ice wyverns, though.",
      "A wyvern has the potential to be an Eldwurm, an old and wise dragon learned in many bodies of knowledge, and are capable of ruminating, casting magic spells and a complex artistic expression. Auroth is a good example of this.",
      "Although dragons in the animated series are mostly classified by their elemental and fundamental power/identity, some dragon types resemble wyverns. Lirrak and her water dragons, including the rogue Auroth, have a wyvern's features. Uldorak and his earth dragons are vestigial wyverns, because they have shortened (hence useless) wings on their arms. The air dragons and their sovereign Aethrak are wyverns too.",
      "Auroth the  Winter Wyvern is the most notable example of a wyvern.",
      "Although most of the Crimson Wyvern's appearance is shown on the equipment forged from its remains, it is hard to tell if it is actually a wyvern, since we don't see the rest of its body, especially the wings which is most important in determining if it's a wyvern. Only its name tells us that it was one.",
      "Karaul Silverwing looks like a wyvern, but the locals call it a dragon or an icewyrm, not to mention that the lore of her stage calls it an icewyrm.",
      "Gastromancer Remi once presented his dish of wyvern filets in order to earn a place amongst the White Orchids, suggesting that wyverns are an exotic delicacy.",
      "Dragon Knight wears a suit of armour made from the remains of this Crimson Wyvern. His suit includes shoulder armor made from its scales, a sword made from its talons, and a pair of bracers made from the interlocking scales on top of its spine",
      "According to the lore of the  Dragon Lance, there exists an ancient faction of merciless wyvern riders. The legendary  Hurricane Pike was their royal sigil.",
      "Aghanim loves wyverns very much and has had romantic relationships with them in the past, his first course of action upon meeting them being seduction.",
      "According to Auroth, dragons (possibly including wyverns) inflict many detriments on civilization, such as razing entire cities down to the ground, enslaving lesser beings and preying on whomever and whatever they please. Thus they're so feared, that the mere sign of a dragon-strike in an area  is enough to make the local people revere the dragon in the hopes that they might be spared. Although Auroth claims to be an artistic dragon, she still can't help being a conventional dragon, as shown when she ate farmer Botfrit's bluehorns.",
      "Queen of Pain hates wyverns. She calls them \"amputee dragons\" because they don't have arms, unlike traditional four-limbed dragons with wings."

Therefore, Laozi had him locked into his furnace so that its flames may reduce him to ashes while distilling him down to Laozi's pills of elixir to be recovered from his remains. Rather than simply willing himself to be stronger in Dota 2's version, Wukong survived by squeezing into the furnace's corner that had Xun (\u2634 or \u5dfd), the fifth of the eight trigrams symbolizing wind. And where there's wind, there is no fire. In this corner, the wind blew smoke into his eyes, causing his eyes to turn red with golden pupils. There he survived for 49 days until the furnace was opened, giving him an opportunity to escape from his shocked enemies before chaos in heaven ensued.",

In this case, duels are used to solve disputes between two soldiers of Stonehall who may have an issue between their last hits. The winner between the two will claim the total share of their opponent. If a duel ends with the death of one participant, recompense will be made, but what this recompense is for is unknown since the document is cut off at that part."

When used during battle, Leshrac can destroy the ground with a burst of Chronoptic energies in  Split Earth, permeate the area around him with multiple bursts and orbs of Chronoptic energy that can evaporate anything that it touches with a  Diabolic Edict that spreads the same torment that afflicts Leshrac to others, and manipulate the very structure of space-time with the Chronoptic energy waves of  Pulse Nova.",

The hidden sage seemingly spoke to her through his orbs, but perhaps these orbs are him. When he chose to reveal himself, all three orbs flew up and converged on each other in a flash of magical light before his pocket dimension became sable. Just for a moment after his orbs converged and disappeared, his floating silhouette was briefly visible until it merged with his darkened dimension as quickly as it appeared, before he finally stepped out of the lightless space and appeared to her in the flesh.",

      "Wex provides the spell's ability to infuse others with its properties of zeal and swiftness, while Exort provides the spell's damage boost.",
      "The magic thrived in the age of Gaster, when it gave mages a powerful option against well-armed adversaries who dared to attack them in close-quarters. Before the advent of the age of Gaster, mages in that situation would simply flee with a burst of defensive magic, implying that Alacrity allowed them to fight enemies head-on.",

      "It seems that not all Forged Spirits look the same. This young Invoker's subservient elementals assume the shapes of fiery dragon hatchlings.",
      "Despite their different appearance, the fiery dragon whelp is still a Forged Spirit in nature, meaning that it's still an elemental\nspirit that is forged from naught. It's unknown why Forge Spirits may differ in appearance or what makes them take on different forms.",
      "Regardless, this means that Forge Spirits do not have a constant form and may be shaped by unknown factors.",
      "Chaos Meteor (also known as Tarak's Descent of Fire, Gallaron's Abyssal Carnesphere, or Voidal Pyroclasm) is a spell invoked with two  Exort and one  Wex.",

      "Exort deals with Chaos Meteor's damaging capabilities and its flames, while Wex deals with the aspects related to its motion\u2015maybe including its path across space and the earth.",

      "The magic essence of Exort has an influence on incubating  Greevils still in their eggs. Exort's influence manifests on the hatched Greevil which will inherit its violent properties.",
      "The  Invoker wields this energies of Exort alongside Quas and Wex. Together with his art of invoking, he can weave spells that inherit Exort's power and properties together with his two other energies that he may use. These energies appear as the elemental spheres that orbit him, which amplifies the damage he deals if he has them active.",
      "The young Invoker states that  Lina uses Exort, which may explain her flame and solar spells. Lina may have gotten it from her training in the flame arts with the Solar Goddess' acolytes and from her blessings from said deity.",
      "The Burning Cabal specializes in and favors fire manipulation through Exort. Part of their uniform is a pair of enchanted bracers to protect against Exort's fire elements.",

Besides the arcane, spells invoked with Quas deal with the power of the mind, wind, and water.\nUnlike the modern version of Quas, the old Invoker's Quas is the attribute of intelligence, which is why it deals with the mind and magic.",

The grim season of winter is the time of slowness in nature\u2014plants grow slower or even stop growing in the cold, animals cease their usual activities and hibernate to preserve their energy, and even that which is shapeless and flowing achieves stasis as it freezes into ice. Because of all this, the cold is often associated with states of stillness such as sleep, death, and equilibrium.",
      "Speaking of equilibrium, the cold being associated with stillness not only applies to our relatively small planet, but it even applies to this cosmos. Case in point, the end of our universe which is the great equilibrium, brought about by none other than its Ancient Apparition: the heat death of the universe. This universe, a system so chaotic with its many processes and changes, tends to move towards equilibrium due to increasing entropy. Order from chaos. Therefore, it seems fitting that any decrease and absence of change belongs to the icy cold, thus the ice and cold elements are aligned to the  Strength attribute which resists change to preserve any that possess it. This is the essence of Quas.",
      "Quas is an arcane energy that allows for the manipulation of ice elements and any properties related to immutability when using magic. Besides energy orbs that orbit the wielder, the cold arcanery of Quas may come in the form of magical crystals infused with said energy and its properties.",

The void is an essential ingredient in the arcane arts, including Quas.",
      "Along with the Invoker's signature Wex and Exort orbs, the elemental magic orb of Quas makes an appearance (and a few uses) in the animated series Dota: Dragon's Blood. According to this series' writer, producer, and creator Ashley Miller; this iteration of the Invoker doesn't mostly rely on the orbs to cast some of his spells. He compares this version of the Invoker's orbs to a \"magical Swiss Army knife\" (suggesting at their versatility) that empowers spells and allows him to cast magics that require these orbs.",

      "It wasn't just the way his magic is used that was changed. Apparently, Quas now has something to do with the essence of water. Listening to the sound effects of his Quas orb, one may hear its sounds of flowing and bubbly liquid. This might have something to do with the fact that Lirrak\u2014the be-all and end-all element of water herself\u2014also has dominion over ice as well. If this is the case, then Quas is now the Water elements in all of its three states: Solid, liquid and gas. Because of this, it's unknown if Dragon's Blood's version of Quas still has the original's properties of stillness, resistance, and whatnot, seeing how water is an element that is quite the opposite with its properties of mutability.",
      "The following are all the instances of the arcane orb Quas being used or the appearances of the arcane orb Quas in the whole animated series, in chronological order.",
      "His Quas orb was first shown in the yellow-green pocket dimension that he trapped Fymryn in, appearing alongside his other orbs. They did not do much besides float around her. The hidden sage seemingly spoke to her through his orbs, but perhaps these orbs are him. When he chose to reveal himself, all three orbs flew up and converged on each other in a flash of magical light before his pocket dimension became sable. Just for a moment after his orbs converged and disappeared, his floating silhouette was briefly visible until it merged with his darkened dimension as quickly as it appeared, before he finally stepped out of the lightless space and appeared to her in the flesh.",
      "All three orbs were orbiting him when the Invoker achieved astral projection to travel to Selemene's astral realm. It's possible that he needed them all to perform this feat.",
      "The Invoker brought all three orbs with him when he confronted Vahdrak in his lair. It's unknown if he used any of them in the ensuing confrontation, since it wasn't shown.",
      "Filomena first demonstrates her inherited sorcery by sending out all three orbs to tear a Radiant Ore specimen from its crash site, somewhere in a snowy montane place. The elemental orbs levitated it into the air before forming a purple containment bubble around it for protection and transport.",
      "When the Invoker visited the Arc Warden in the Mad Moon, he was protected from the vacuum of space by a golden shield, and brought all three orbs with him, indicating that he was ready for any potential combat. During their fight, the Invoker attacked Zet with a handful of flames, the element of Exort.",

But Mirana walked through it unimpeded with her divine powers, indicated by her eyes glowing bright yellow like the sun.",
      "When Mirana mentions the Forge in the world before Experiment 12,403 to Filomena, who was discussing her plan with the Heroes to avert the upcoming cataclysm, Filomena fused all three orbs with the Archronicus to create a hologram of the current universe's version of the Forge that she can use to remotely control the true machine from.",
      "The mental and mnemonic sorcery of  Invoke can be used to manipulate Quas energy. Spells invoked with Quas will inherit its elements and its properties.",
      "Spells invoked by said mnemonic sorcery are also called hexes, incantations, and invocations, with no distinction between each of them.",
      "The following is a comprehensive list of magical spells that use the icy energies and the resistant properties of Quas.",
      "Cold Snap (also known as Sadron's Protracted Frisson or Quas Frigoris) is a crippling, elemental hex whose magical formula is  Quas Trionis.",
      "The names \u201cCold Snap\u201d or \u201cProtracted Frisson\u201d imply the spell briefly freezes a target by sapping their heat to chill them deeply, which may be prolonged by additional attacks.",
      "As a spell solely composed and invoked of Quas, it draws upon its icy elements and its properties of immutability to briefly freeze targets and prolong its fleeting chill.",
      "Ghost Walk (also known as Myrault's Hinder-Gast or Geist of Lethargy) is an invisibility invocation whose magical formula is two  Quas orbs and one  Wex.",
      "This spell manipulates the ice and electrical energies around the caster, rendering their body invisible. As a result, an elemental imbalance will occur due to the opposite properties of Quas and Wex and the spell having more of the former than the latter. The imbalance manifests as an aura that slows both the caster and nearby enemies.",
      "Ghost Walk draws upon Quas' properties to slow the movement of nearby enemies (just like what the spell's fancier names suggest), while Wex's properties of swiftness is dulled by the elemental imbalance, thus the spell also impedes its caster. Its self-crippling effects may be offset by having more of Wex's power active, though.",
      "It's unknown where the spell sources its ability to turn the caster invisible. Here are two speculations for each of the two elements that compose this spell.",
      "Tornado (also known as Claws of Tornarus or Wex cyclonus) is a disruptive wind spell whose magical formula involves invoking two  Wex and one  Quas.",
      "The spell brings forth a big and fast moving tornado that sweeps up anything in its path. Suspended in the air by its whirling winds, victims are subject to its dizzying motion and heights until the tornado dissipates, causing them to plummet to their doom.",
      "Wex provides the spell's winds and properties of motion, while Quas' properties may be involved in prolonging the tornado's life, thus extending its victims' airtime.",
      "Regardless, this spell brings the power of the \"White Waste\" to the battlefield, creating a slippery wall of ice that emanates an aura of debilitating cold.",
      "The spell draws upon Quas for its ice and the bitter cold that it emits to slow nearby victims, while Exort may be the one that makes the ice wall's aura deal damage.",
      "Speaking of the White Waste, this place might be the cold northern realm of Icewrack, which is also known as the Frozen Waste. \"White\" may refer to its literal color, since the place is a desert of ice and snow. \u201cWrack\u201d and \u201cwaste\u201d are, in a way, synonymous. In that case, the spell of Ice Wall could be included in the Frozen Arts. This might be what the child Invoker actually meant when he calls upon ice and storm to create a wall of ice, since spells of the Frozen Arts channel the elements of Icewrack, such as ice and wind.",
      "Forged Spirits (a.k.a. Culween's Most Cunning Fabrications, Ravagers of Armor and Will, and Grief Elementals) are created by invoking two  Exort and one  Quas.",
      "It seems that not all Forged Spirits look the same. This young Invoker's subservient elementals assume the shapes of fiery dragon hatchlings.",
      "Despite their different appearance, the fiery dragon whelp is still a Forged Spirit in nature, meaning that it's still an elemental\nspirit that is forged from naught. It's unknown why Forge Spirits may differ in appearance or what makes them take on different forms.",
      "Regardless, this means that Forge Spirits do not have a constant form and may be shaped by unknown factors.",
      "Deafening Blast (also known as Buluphont's Aureal Incapacitator) is a spell that's invoked using one of each orb:  Quas,  Wex, and  Exort.",
      "Using all three elements at once, this spell unleashes a mighty sonic wave that deafens those caught in its blast, leaving them reeling from the attack.",
      "Gameplay wise, its Quas knocks back enemies, Wex disarms them, and Exort deals damage. Lorewise, Quas and Wex should be swapped since it fits their respective properties better.",
      "The magic essence of Quas has an influence on incubating  Greevils still in their eggs. Quas' influence manifests on the Greevil baby which will inherit its determined properties.",
      "An unknown shaman once healed Ursa by drawing healing power from the surrounding icicles, implying the ice element has healing properties that can be drawn upon like Quas.",
      "All frost magics flow through the  Blueheart Conduit, from the Frozen Arts to the icy energy of Quas. Anyone who wields them are recipients of her gifts.",
      "The  Invoker wields the energies of Quas alongside Exort and Wex. Together with his art of  Invoke, he can weave up to six well remembered spells that inherit Quas' element and properties together with the two other energies that he may use. These energies appear as the elemental spheres that orbit him, which heals him if he has them active.",
      "Crystal Maiden might be a user of the arcane energy Quas for the following reasons:",
      "Lich uses \u201cfrost magic\u201d or \u201cfrost manipulation\u201d for all of his ice spells. They come from the Conduit of Blueheart, who is also the conduit of Quas and any spells that use it.",
      "Tiny's earthy body can be infused with the strength of glacial ice, granting him the power to lay his enemies to waste. It's possible that this power is the magic of Quas.",

      "Winter Wyvern's  Cold Embrace is quite similar to Quas with its freezing, slowing, and healing. However, there's no explicit mention of Quas being used.",
      "Known mages who are connected to the Invoker's spells that use the arcane energies of Quas include Buluphont, Culween, Koryx, Myrault, Sadron, and Tornarus.",
      "The Dark Magus Gallaron might be a user of Quas since the orb for this arcane energy orbits his in-game model.",
      "The Blueheart Glacier of Icewrack is the conduit through which all frost magics of the world flow, including Quas and some spells that use it.",
      "Quas is featured on Ultimyr Academy's insignia. This is related to the fact that Ultimyr once taught its students how to  Invoke, which is complementary with Quas, Wex, and Exort.",
      "An injured and freezing  Ursa was healed by an unknown shaman who bound parts of his life-force to the nearby icicles. He now proudly wears a full set of fur armour attached with the same spellbound ice as a trophy of his victory over death. Ice having innate healing properties that are accessible via magic might be a connection to Quas.",

      "Poison Sting by you and your wards can severely cripple the movement speed of high-ranking creep-heroes.",
      "Venomancer in this mode is given two warding skills, featuring the regular  Plague Wards and the Scourge Wards. These Scourge Wards can use their own  Venomous Gale at a lower range and without the slow debuff. These gales can stack with your own Venomous Gale, allowing the enemies to suffer twice the poison. Note however that multiple Venomous Gales from different Scourge Wards will not stack, and will simply refresh the poison timer.",
      "Poison Nova is a devastating AoE skill that can slowly lay waste to enemies from every direction. Note that enemies suffering from the Nova cannot die from it alone as it will stop damaging the units once they reach 1 HP.",
      "Using  Plague Wards,  Venomous Gale and  Poison Nova on chicken levels will maximize the gold drop rate as the poison effect will be very effective in triggering it.",
      "Despite the poisonous advantage, Venomancer's skills diminish in effect against creep-heroes with HP regeneration, especially those regenerating for more than +30 HP/S, making his skills near-useless against Alchemist and Invoker.",

      "Presence of the Dark Lord is basically a free Assault Cuirass effect on enemies. Stacking armor reduction effects is very effective against big enemies like the Chemists and the 4 Invoker. Together with Desolator, Solar Crest and Assault Cuirass, enemies lose a huge amount of armor.",
      "Blade Fury is a very strong wave clearer on the early rounds thanks to its high damage, and a great survivability booster on later waves, as it grants Juggernaut high evasion.",
      "An early level  Blade Dance significantly boosts Blade Fury's damage, as its damage can crit based on Blade Dance's level. In the lategame, Blade Dance greatly bosts Juggernaut's attack damage.",

      "Storm Spirit has a lot of magical damage burst with  Static Remnant which allows him to clear early waves quite fast. The biggest advantage Static Remnant has is that it can be cast on the run, Storm Spirit neither needs to turn, nor to stop to cast it",
      "Overload grants Storm Spirit a second area damage spell, which also heavily slows enemies for a short while. On top of that, Overload's effects are applied to Static Remnant, hitting all enemies hit by the Remnant's damage, meaning the remnant effectively deals more damage and slows enemies.",
      "Electric Vortex is a very strong AoE disable which ignores enemy disable immunity. This means it can stop and pull Roosters and Chickens.",
      "Since Electric Vortex pulls enemies towards the center, it can serve as a poor man's Black Hole, creating combos with allied spells. Especially on the 10th round, it can pull and disable multiple chickens.",
      "Ball Lightning is the best mobility spell available in Dark Moon. It allows Storm Spirit to quickly travel the map, while also dealing area damage around him. With the right items, he can roll over enemies and instantly kill smaller mobs while also damaging the bigger ones. Due to its lack of cooldown, he can avoid damage quite easily even when standing between enemy masses.",
      "Storm Spirit's items should include high intelligence items, like  Scythe of Vyse,  Bloodthorn and  Octarine Core. Scythe grants an additional disable which is always useful, while Octarine Core allows Storm Spirit to cast Electric Vortex more often, on top of healing him from the damage his spells deal.",
      "Bloodthorn is great on Storm Spirit for the same reason why it is great on him in default Dota. On top of this, Bloodthorn is extremely powerful in Dark Moon, making it the best item pick-up for Storm Spirit.",
      "Nature's Call summons very tanky treants which can take care of a lane on their own, although they cannot usually kill the waves, they can lure them for long enough to keep the tower alive",
      "The treants are ignored by spell-casting enemies, they only cast them on heroes. This makes them perfect for tanking enemies with disables while carries pick them off from afar.",
      "Since  Sprout does not technically disable enemies, but traps them so they cannot move, it one of the very few abilities able to stop Roosters and chickens.",
      "The typical self-sprout +  Teleportation combo allows Nature's Prophet to escape sticky situations in which other heroes most likely would have died.",
      "Moving right on top of an allied grave and casting Sprout on self allows Nature's Prophet to safely resurect allies.",
      "Wrath of Nature hits many enemies and deals decent damage, but is still a rather weaker nuke as compared to other spells. However, once having  Aghanim's Scepter, it becomes very powerful as it pumps the map full with treants. Greater Treants do not spawn though, since none of the enemies are considered heroes.",
      "Leshrac's massive area magic damage output makes him an excellent pick, as he can effectively damage an enormous amount of enemies, and also can deal with single big enemies on his own.",
      "Leshrac consumes large amounts of mana and is not too resilient. Therefore, players will usually include items that make up for this, such as  Solar Crest or  Eul's Scepter of Divinity.",
      "Scythe of Vyse and  Bloodthorn quench Lesh's glutton mana pool while providing helpful disables for alchemist and invoker rounds.",
      "Pulse Nova is highly effective. It quickly tears through mobs. When facing the final boss, it is a perfect quell for the large number of fire minions.",
      "Pulse Nova works on round 10 roshlings. The fact Leshrac can move while it is active is an advantage when compared to File:Dark Moon/Medusa minimap icon.png Dark Moon/Medusa.",
      "Paralyzing Cask has a low cooldown, so it can be spammed quite a bit. It aloso has a long stun duration against the smaller enemies, making it a decent gap creator for Witch Doctor, allowing him to resurrect allies more safely.",
      "Voodoo Restoration is a potent heal, which can be kept active permanently with the right items.",
      "Maledict can potentially deal insane amounts of damage, especially against bigger targets. Since its damage scales exponentially and is based on how much damage the target took, it can quickly kill big enemies like Whale-eaters.",
      "Against the Dark Magus, Maledict has to be timed right. The best time to use it is immediately as the fight begins, and always directly after his tornado/sunstrike meteor spams end. If timed wrongly, Maledict may lose ticks due to the invulnerability the Dark Magus gets while spamming tornadoes/sun strikes and meteors.",
      "Death Ward has very high dps and is able to attack multiple targets. Positioning is very important to cast this, since it is a channeled ability. Combined with Maledict, Witch Doctor can quickly kill big single targets even on his own.",
      "Since Witch Doctor soley relies on his spells, he needs mana regeneration.  Octarine Core is very strong on him, as it allows him to keep Voodoo Restoration active during whole rounds, and allows him to cast his other spells more often. Maledict and Death Ward have an above average cooldown time, so that Octarine Core has a greater effect.",
      "In order to be able to safely channel Death Ward, a  Glimmer Cape may be required.",
      "An early  Magic Wand can help keep heroes alive, as many charges are gained from enemy abilities.",

      "Aura based items such as  Vladmir's Offering,  Shiva's Guard,  Crimson Guard,  Assault Cuirass and  Guardian Greaves will benefit your team a lot more than single target / burst items.",
      "Bloodthorn is the best single target item against wave bosses. The crit is distributed to the whole team and grants true strike.",

      "Far too little is known about Gorroth, besides it being an authority or tutelary entity of great power since its inscrutable potency is invoked by a certain warlock.",
      "Given Warlock's shady background, Gorroth is probably characterized by darkness. Demnok may say \"sworn of shadows\" or \"dark litany\" when attacking. Since the only entity that he swears to is Gorroth for its power, then \"sworn of shadows\" might refer to these \"shadows\" swearing something as so, with these \"shadows\" being Demnok and Gorroth. However, it's possible it could be meant for Demnok only and not the Gorroth he consorts with, since the former usually embodies himself as darkness.",
      "As for what \"Dark litany\" has to do with who or what Gorroth is, \"litany\" comes from Greek \u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 meaning \"prayer\", which comes from Greek \u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae meaning \"supplication\". Thus \"Dark litany\" would be Demnok imploring the aid of someone or something else, akin to him invoking the power of Gorroth. That being said, a \"dark litany\" could also be Demnok repeatedly reciting incantations to curse his opponent, like a real religious litany where prayers are recited repeatedly.",
      "Also, Demnok usually invokes darkness to bedevil his enemies, so perhaps this darkness he calls upon is Gorroth itself. His  Upheaval spell also invokes darkness, so perhaps his spell is derived from Gorroth too. Lastly, those who are killed by Demnok are sent away to consort with shadows. In conclusion, Gorroth might be a tutelary entity of shadows to Demnok who lends its dark power to him.",
      "Warlock is the only known hero with a link to Gorroth. Demnok may invoke Gorroth's power as his authority that allows him to do whatever, in this case, mundane walking."

      "Inai is not so explicit with his affinity to order, but he does encompass fate and balance (not to mention that his machinations usually involve control, planning, and calculation, which inclines to order) and finds no ally in those aligned to chaos. He seeks to avert the chaos that he only knows as The Great Confluence.",
      "Although Elder Titan was responsible for compromising the world's wholeness by separating it, he still seeks amends for his great mistake and yearns for unity and wholeness once again. Those who are slain by him are returned to Unity including the four Fundamentals.",
      "Enigma may not look the part, but he is aligned to order. Like his creator, he seeks to reunite something that was torn asunder, possibly referring to the great rift that encompasses all of existence. Those who are slain by Enigma achieve final harmony/returned to Unity. Not to mention that gravity is a force that keeps things together, hence the Unity theme.",
      "Ezalor is the antithesis of chaos. His lines towards Chaos Knight suggest that he can bend chaos to order. Such was his quest that his solar descendants followed in his footsteps to keep chaos at bay.\nHowever, he is implied to be responsible for disrupting the Primordial harmony that bound the 4 Fundamentals together in their realm. That definitely doesn't sound like order...",

      "Order is a mysterious concept in the lore of Dota 2, often spoken about by entities of cosmic consequence or other lesser beings who may have an affinity for it.",
      "Order is the antithesis of chaos, which means that order is what makes up existence and creation. Order can be made from chaos and vice versa. Order itself is vague and information about it is sparse, but it does encompass the following stuff compared to its counterparts in chaos. Note that some of them may not have a known counterpart yet.",
      "It is said to have different levels, both high and low. Reaching higher levels of order is accompanied by enlightenment while dying in some ways causes one to achieve a lower state of order, although it may only apply to forces of chaos who can actually bring others into lower states of order. There is also an ultimate level of order which seems to be achieved in death. This ultimate level of order may refer to the final harmony that all beings achieve when they die. It's possible that this final harmony is the unknown plane of existence where everyone is interconnected to each other.",

As a force of order, he disdains the stuff of chaos (and others who bring it) such as disunity and disharmony, although he isn't appalled enough by it to prevent himself from exploiting his own disunity.",

Like all Brewmasters before him, he searches for enlightenment through imbibement to find the single thought that would unite the great rift between the material and spiritual planes once again.",
      "Dawnbreaker is the sole herald of the Children of Light, who once strived to spread light to the cosmos and bend chaos to order. Even in her weakened state, she still possesses the ability to create order from the chaos found within each scene of strife to recharge herself.",
      "Among the Celestial brothers, only the  Earth Spirit, the  Ember Spirit, and the  Void Spirit value order. Raijin has absolutely nothing to do with this order, especially with his jovial and rebellious nature. However, all four Celestials were complicit in Sun Wukong's punishment for disrupting the cycle of nature, demonstrating their affinity to order.",
      "Among the five Founders,  Elder Titan,  Enigma, and  Keeper of the Light are aligned to order.",
      "Mars claims that gods can forge order from the chaos. It's unknown if this applies to all kinds of gods outside of his pantheon or to his own pantheon only.",
      "Just like their most prominent member, the Order of the Oyo seek to find the one thought that would unite the shattered world that we live in. The Aesthetes of this order gather in holy reverie atop the peaks where the wheel books are to anticipate the song produced by these books when the sacred wind blows upon it. The books sing about a great rift that encompasses all of existence, which was made after The Wailing One conceived a single paradoxical thought. The Wailing One could not think this thought and become one being, rending it asunder and creating the multiplanar universe of the Dota 2 world.",

He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took\u2014to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.There was bitterness within the House Avernus\u2014elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities.

However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy.In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research.When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike.They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit.  In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil's Alchemic transmutation once more."

This elemental is naught but an image, a mere projection of a greater being that exists outside time in the cold, infinite void\u2014a presence that predates the universe and awaits its end at the moment of the great equilibrium.",
      "Mere apocrypha dictates that as the cosmos ages and is ushered to its final moments by time, Kaldr's light and power will grow ever stronger. His Ancient moniker will lose its meaning as he defies time's aging and grows younger, his grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold and herald the coming of the great equilibrium!",

His lore suggests that he embodies the heat death of the universe, as implied in his lore which mentions the cessation of matter in the time of the great equilibrium. Kaldr's earliest depictions were once recorded in unreadable texts written in an extinct language. Archivists from the Ultimyr Archives have found these texts and one of them attempted to use a deciphering spell to read it, but was driven mad as a result.",
      "The power that we observe from Kaldr is but a fainted echo of his true cosmic form. His powers are limited to a worldly ice elemental that can manipulate cold and ice, but soon Kaldr will gradually grow stronger as the end of the universe approaches where he will be able to stop matter itself. It would seem that he is no mere elemental however, since he can control time to a minor extent.",
      "Outside of  Cold Feet's effect in gameplay, the lore for this ability implies that it is much more powerful than what we see from his gameplay. The ability's lore describes that just his mere presence can draw those around him into a frozen void, where they will be locked in an \"icy prison\" for eternity. This \"frozen void\" might be the same cold and infinite void where Kaldr's image springs from outside time, which means that this ability is no mere freezing spell, but rather a gateway beyond time and into the void itself.",
      "Kaldr manipulates frozen, caustic winds at a whim, creating an  Ice Vortex that freezes the area and anyone caught in its area of effect.",
      "Chilling Touch allows Kaldr to use his \"eternal knowledge\" to imbue his attacks with a frigid enchantment. The old lore for this ability before it was reworked once stated that this also enchants his allies.",
      "Channeling ice storms from ages past through his frosty limbs, Kaldr releases their power through an  Ice Blast that crashes into the world and freezes anyone caught in its ill wake into statues of ice. The lore implies that these ice storms are actually drawn from time periods in the past before being sent into the present by Kaldr, hinting at some form of temporal power."

Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their unliving lord's poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether."

      "Before the beginning of all, there existed a presence: a primordial mind, infinite, awesome, and set to inscrutable purpose. As the universe thundered into being, this mind was fragmented and scattered. Two among its greater fragments\u2014who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.As war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin's conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet's strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time's end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.Life flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet's struggles to contain them. As the captives' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet's depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison's ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.Flung to the farthest reaches by the prison's explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many\u2014some lesser, some greater\u2014each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further\u2026"
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Zet only refers to itself by the names Zet or Self, and refers to it's split form as Selves; however in the Dota Anime, Zet also uses the pronouns We and I.",
      "From the shattered Primordial Consciousness, Zet the Arc Warden wills itself into being with one goal in mind: to restore unity by reuniting the fragments of Radiant and Dire back into the one unified intelligence that they once were at the beginning of the universe, or destroy them both should the conflict spread even further.",
      "Before the universe came to be, there was a singular presence: an ancient consciousness, the Primordial Mind, an infinite intelligence who could think inscrutable thoughts that no mind of the past, present, and future can hope to penetrate. In the moment when the universe was created, this mind was shattered into many fragments. Although all of these parts shared the same progenitor, these mental fragments soon gained individuality. Two among its greater fragments\u2014Radinthul and Diruulth--fought each other and twisted all of creation with their powers of enthrallment to serve their conflict.",
      "In this cascade of moments, a third greater fragment, the unsung Ancient, made itself known. This intellect named itself Zet and strived to stop the appalling disharmony that it had just witnessed in the first moments of its conception. Focusing all of its power, Zet overwhelmed both of its siblings and fused them into a single form, trapping them both in an inert crystalline sphere. Zet hurled this sphere into the darkness of space to be adrift for eternity until the gravitational force of a burgeoning planet captured this body and turned it into its satellite. The cost of this imprisonment drained most of its strength, but Zet was determined to use its remaining power to sentence itself into an eternal vigil.",
      "Time passes by and the once nondescript world became teeming with primitive lifeforms that rose into significance and then fell into naught but apocrypha. But in each generation of this life cycle, none could escape the glare of this eerie celestial body (which they soon named \"The Mad Moon\" in their lore) that appeared at all times of the day. Meanwhile, the warring Ancients resolved to escape their prison using the reverberations of their clash, tidal forces, and the orbital stress acting between the planet and their prison. Zet used its weakened powers to contain the breach, but on one fateful night, the Mad Moon was shattered and the resulting explosion expelled moonstuff at high velocity towards the planet and destroyed its surface in an extinction event.",
      "The Ancients were freed, but they returned in a new form that they stole from the very material that made up their prison. As for Zet, it was flung to the farthest reaches of space and warped by the dissonant energies of his siblings. No longer of single form or thought, Zet embodied the very concept that Zet despises the most: disharmony. They were disunited into many parts, a fractured consciousness much like its progenitor. Using the remaining power that they had left, Zet struggled to reunite their separated elements into a single goal and travelled the cosmos to rejoin the fray against the Ancients who had resumed their war.",
      "Zet was among the many heroes who were gathered in the Sundered Moon bar. Unlike the other heroes socializing with each other, Zet sat alone in the corner of the pub as if the Self was waiting for someone. Overhearing a conversation between a certain amorous god and his unlucky prey, the Self provoked the former to get his attention, calling him a half-god.",
      "The vexed \"half god\" left his potential lover and confronted this strange hooded figure by himself. Zet taunts the deity with its superior origins, but Zeus retorts with quips on its lack of pronouns and poor enunciation. Adding to his words, he took the Self's taunts as an invitation to a fight. The Self declares him half correct, saying that Self only came here to fight. Annoyed with this meaningless ebb and flow of talk, Zeus reminded the stranger about why they were all gathered here, telling the Self that anyone it picks a fight with in this bar will tear down an Ancient the next day. Undaunted by his boldness, Zet corrects the half-god by saying that the Self will not destroy one Ancient, but both of them.",
      "Zet revealed a projection of the lore about the two ancient intellects from the \"world before your world\", Radinthul and Diruulth. It told the story of their battle, imprisonment, and escape. Zet reveals to him that the Ancients have been building an army of lesser creatures to serve their conflict, and if either Ancient were to win, their power would end \"both of their worlds\". Such a grand task could not be done alone, and like its Ancient siblings, it seeks to amass an army aligned against both Ancients. Zet handed him a scroll and told him to fulfill whatever mystery was inside it.",
      "Unsure of whatever nonsense that Zet had just talked about, Zeus asked the Self if he had any stake in this war. Zet promised him that the Self would \"make him whole again\" should they be successful in the destruction of both Ancients. Still having doubts with the Self's offer, Zeus asked him to verify this claim by giving him a \"taste of this wholeness\". The Self agreed and returned to him a small fragment of his rightful power, including a golden helm rimming with divine power.",
      "Satisfied, Zeus relished in his newfound power, completely ignoring the nonsense that led to this moment. He invites the Self to hear about his divorce story while offering it some ambrosia. The Self politely declines because it has work to do, before revealing six other scrolls like the one it gave to Zeus.",
      "The Mad Moon's destruction introduced the shards of Radiant Ore and Direstone to the burgeoning planet where most of Dota 2's story takes place. These shards contained the very presence of the two greater fragments of the Primordial Consciousness, both known as Radiant and Dire or Radinthul and Diruulth by Zet. But a third stone\u2014known as Nemestice\u2014was left uncorrupted by the Ancients. Instead, it contained the power that Zet sacrificed aeons ago to seal its warring siblings together into one form, eventually trapping it within an inert crystalline sphere that would become the vessels for both of the Ancients' power.",
      "At the moment when the Mad Moon exploded from within, the shards that contained the Radiant and Dire essence were flung by the blast and captured by the gravitational pull of its celestial companion before falling to earth, with some of these shards being flung away into space or destroyed by the heat of atmospheric entry. However, the Nemestice stones remained afloat within the ruins of the Mad Moon, left behind by its ancient fugitives.",
      "Aeons later, Arc Warden's magnetic compass revealed the impact site of a prophesied Nemestice storm that would precede a meteor shower of the other Nemestice stones. They finally fell to earth in the present age to rejoin the fray against both Ancients, ready to be reclaimed by the jailer of the Ancients...or anyone seeking control over both of them.",
      "Zet is building an army of Heroes to fight against Radinthul and Diruulth. So far, it has currently recruited  Zeus into its ranks.",
      "Zet is ill-disposed towards Radinthul and Diruulth ever since it willed itself into being.",
      "Zet is the third greater fragment of the Primordial Mind, an infinite disembodied consciousness. Although Zet recognizes itself as an individual consciousness, it is still the Primordial Consciousness in essence, because it refers to Radinthul and Diruulth as its other selves.",
      "In its current form, Zet has been warped by the dissonant energies released by the Mad Moon's destruction. It was so powerful that not only did it send the Self flying into the farthest reaches of space, but it even split its disembodied mind into many mental fragments of varying power\u2014some lesser, some greater. With his power weakened, Zet struggled to restore itself back to a whole form, whereas its prime form was able to fuse both Ancients. The result was Zet being able to control its shattered fragments, but it's still not powerful enough to make itself whole. He can still fuse his fractured elements (excluding his main self) to create a clone via  Tempest Double, but it is nowhere close to what he once was.",
      "Thence Zet was transformed into a collective consciousness\u2014a mind consisting of many individuals who think the same thoughts in unison. Zet is many, yet it is only one.",
      "Zet is an extremely powerful being. The Self overwhelmed both Ancients in a single stroke and fused them into one form, before locking them into the Mad Moon. However, this task drained most of Zet's power, but it has not been consumed into nothing. Instead, the power that it used was locked in the moon as well, which it seeks to reclaim through the rare Nemestice storms to restore itself back to full power.",
      "The Self also has the powers of creation. Zet was able to create a massive celestial body made of crystals to seal the Ancients within it and prevent them from influencing the outside world. As a force of order and unity, Zet can make broken or incomplete things whole again. Besides its attempt to fuse the 2 greater splinters of the Primordial Mind and its attempt to partially fuse itself after Zet was warped by his siblings' energies, Zet was able to casually restore a portion of Zeus' lost powers and imbued him with the energies of the Ancients themselves, making him partially \"whole\" again.",
      "Zet has the ability to summon draconic wraiths from another plane, who gladly serve the warden in exchange for sustenance. By using the Self's being as a bridge between the wraiths' plane of existence and the mortal plane, Zet can call upon these wraiths who will consume the energies found in the mortal plane. The energies they consume in the mortal plane will manifest tenfold of its power in their home plane.",
      "Zet's in-game abilities utilize kindred forces with  Io, who also uses electromagnetism. This makes sense with its theme of order and unity, since both electricity and magnetism are binding forces.",
      "Flux is the same power that Zet used to imprison the Ancients. In its current form, it has been heavily weakened due to Zet's power being depleted from fusing and imprisoning the Ancients. At its weakest, this power manifests as a discharge of volatile, fluxing energies that will electrocute anyone unfortunate enough to receive this shocking energy.",
      "By distorting space itself, Zet can generate a  Magnetic Field to protect anyone within it from incoming attacks. It's possible that this field deflects attacks by either repelling the attacks with magnetism or distorting space to cause attacks to miss.",
      "Calling upon a lesser fragment of its fractured being, Zet summons a  Spark Wraith to perform a watchful vigil around a certain place. Upon materializing, the wraith will patrol the chosen area until it finds a trespasser. The wraith will be drawn to them, infusing the trespasser with harmful magic upon contact.",
      "Willfully accepting its disunity, a temporary  Tempest Double of the Self is created when Zet fuses its fractured elements into a single form, creating a perfect electrical duplicate of itself to bring twice the chaos and disharmony to the fight\u2014two concepts that Zet absolutely despises. Perhaps the same process that creates Zet's double was the same process that it used to fuse the two Ancients back into a single form, but the incompatible intellects managed to retain their individuality and resisted the process."

His rise through the ranks was helped by the fact that he never hesitated to decapitate a superior. Through the seven year Campaign of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter, while the number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. On the night of ultimate victory, Axe declared himself the new Red Mist General, and took on the ultimate title of 'Axe.' But his troops now numbered zero. Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant number had also fallen to Axe's blade. Needless to say, most soldiers now shun his leadership. But this matters not a whit to Axe, who knows that a one-man army is by far the best."

      "Mogul used to hold the title of the Reaper, a high ranking soldier who would slay any deserters in the Red Mist army. To those who are granted the position of Reaper, they are given tattoos that express the responsibility that they must carry and the respect that it bestows on those who wear it.",
      "After the fall of the Red Mist, Mogul Khan may have joined or destroyed the Bloodmist army.",
      "The story takes place in the Hazhadal Barrens where Mogul and Goodkind have managed to reach the northern gate of the Fortress of Valhessi. Mogul greets the gatekeeper and introduces him to his bard Goodkind. He cheerfully inquires him about the location of the Fortress of Valhessi and the seven jeweled crown that is guarded by five \"unstoppable\" Zongom warriors, but the gatekeeper's taciturn nature forces Axe to stop his charade.",
      "Slightly annoyed, Mogul asks for his name so that Goodkind may do his \"bard thing\" but the gatekeeper simply refuses to do so. Mogul convinces him again by saying that his bard needs to record his name for the sake of \"accuracy of the historical records\" which prompts the gatekeeper to reveal his name. Grigrikh introduces himself in an intimidating manner and taunts Mogul by calling him a \"little pink ape\". Likely offended by his remarks, Mogul leaves the scene without Goodkind, supposedly leaving him to be eaten by Grigrikh.",
      "However, Goodkind reveals that Mogul did not leave him and he arrives shortly to perform his signature  Culling Blade on Grigrikh, instantly killing him and destroying the gate behind him. With these moments, Goodkind successfully writes down the first few lines of their adventure. They venture into the castle and are greeted by an army of Valhessi soldiers. Fighting his way through the horde, Goodkind writes down the scene with some of his own embellishment (e.g. writing that Mogul was a disciplined fighter even though he was clearly enjoying the fight) until they made their way into the final chamber of the castle.",
      "The five \"unstoppable\" Zongom warriors have been waiting for the intruders and they greet them with an eerie and synchronized speech. Axe halts their speech to take a moment with Goodkind, who might have thought that Mogul hesitated out of fear. Mogul makes it clear that he was simply weirded out by their unexpected speech and tells him not to write that he was scared of the Zongom warriors. He readies himself for battle and tells Goodkind to stop writing and watch him fight. Mogul decapitates the first warrior, does his second ultimate  Culling Blade on the second warrior, disembowels the third and fourth warriors, and finally kills the last warrior in a fit of rage.",
      "Mogul and Goodkind proceed into the throne room, where they find the Sorcerer King of Valhessi on his knees, supplicating them to spare him by offering the crown and the other riches of his throne room. Disappointed that their adventure has an anticlimatic ending, Mogul accepts the crown, but he is suddenly transferred into the body of the king, who reveals that he has swapped bodies with him and is now possessing Mogul. The Sorcerer King chases after Goodkind, while Mogul tries to rid himself of the spell. Goodkind tells him to destroy the source of the spell as it might be a channeled spell.",
      "Rummaging through the throne room, Axe breaks every trinket that he can find to undo the spell, but to no avail. He realizes that the crown might be the source and holds it above his head exclaiming \"Sorcerer! Behold your talisman!\" and shatters it. The Sorcerer King ridicules his foolishness and says that he does not keep all of his power in mere jewelries. With quick thinking, Mogul realizes that his body is the source of the spell and runs out off the window to fall to his supposed death. The spell is nullified and Mogul returns to his body, much to the surprise of Goodkind who jots down what happened soon after.",
      "With the draft for their next novel accomplished, Axe wonders where they should go next while Goodkind sends his draft with a carrier raven. After suggesting a few locations that they have already explored, Goodkind tells him that their stories are getting a bit repetitive and their book sales have been going down in several cities. He suggests joining the battle of the Ancients, which Mogul hesitates at first until he mentions that even gods will be joining the fight, leaving Mogul to reconsider it.",
      "Axe once fought a gryftok. Wounded, the beast ran into a river, and Axe pursued, against Goodkind's protests. In the struggle, he dropped his axe in the river. Using his bare hands, Axe choked the gryftok to death, then used its body like a raft, falling asleep on it as it drifted down the river. He woke as the raft was about to go over a waterfall, just in time to hit his head on a rock. When he woke up, he was naked and alone in a jungle, possibly Fellstrath.",
      "While in the jungle, he befriended a spider, and learned some herbal remedies.",
      "Axe is frequently accompanied by his scribe Goodkind. Whenever they go out on an adventure, he writes down everything that occurs in it, but he may also resort to embellishing his stories. Afterwards, he publishes these stories and sells them to different cities. Thanks to these stories, Axe's reputation has grown tremendously, but there are also critics and haters who regard these stories as stale and trashy. Axe has also started to train him in the arts of combat, starting with swordsmanship.",
      "Axe has cast himself away from his fellow Oglodi, but he still retains their inner hatred for demons, which he expresses by paying Anessix an unfriendly visit. He also dislikes to kill other Oglodi. As for his fellow Oglodi,  Disruptor is keeping an eye on Axe in White Spire for reasons unknown.  Warlock encourages Axe to be intelligent like him and Disruptor and if he plays his cards right, he might even teach him how to read.",
      "Like all other Oglodi, Mogul Khan hates the Keen but he makes an exception for  Sniper whom he considers as a worthy opponent.",
      "Mogul Khan is being hunted by Sorla, a fellow Oglodi who took over leadership of the Red Mist army after he decimated it. When she catches him, she plans to flay him. Due to Sorla's bloodthirsty and violent nature,  Juggernaut wishes to discuss with Mogul on how to best deal with her."

Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks.Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation. He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature's savagery."

The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers taking direct possession of their hound."

      "Strygwyr's canine embodiment has deeply affected him on many levels besides his body, including his speech (sometimes) and his temperament when he is frenzied by bloodshed.",
      "Although his outward appearance would say otherwise to those who are unwitting, Strygwyr is not a simpleminded beast. Outside of harvesting expeditions, he wanders far from his home as an anthropologist, thoroughly studying the cultures of any land that just so happens to intrigue him.",
      "Strygwyr is a faithful and religious person. He does all of his slaughterings not out of sadism or cruelty, but with a ritualistic purpose\u2014proof that he puts his bloody faith into practice. Although it may seem cruel, he only does this to feed his gods and receive their mercy and blessings in return, allowing his people and homeland to thrive.\nBecause of his faith, he is a very spiritual person who dislikes selfish sacrifices and materialist lifestyles.\nIt's implied that his faith to the gods compels him to honor and respect his chosen sacrifices.",
      "Because of his faith, he is a very spiritual person who dislikes selfish sacrifices and materialist lifestyles.",
      "It's implied that his faith to the gods compels him to honor and respect his chosen sacrifices.",
      "When  Snapfire meets him, her responses imply that Strygwyr has a rather friendly side to his personality. He seems to be offering cookies for unknown reasons, but the implications would say that he is doing it out of friendliness. It may not be canon, since it might be a reference to his voice line when he kills someone via Rupture.",
      "Strygwyr the Bloodseeker is a blood rite hunter, a vicious hunter of his faith that was ritually bound by the Blood Oath. He is but one of the many known as \"Those Who Ever-Thirst\" who faithfully serve the Flayed Twins, a pair of unstoppable deities who can only be pacified by blood to stave their vicious thirst.",
      "Granted by his gods the energy of a ferocious hound and the power to wield his patrons' divine blood, this dogged yet spiritual hunter descends from the lofty peaks of Xhacatocatl with one goal in mind: to search for those willing and unwilling and release the gift of life that flows within their bodies.",
      "Bound to the will of the Raw Twins by honor and the Blood Oath, Strygwyr is a ritually sanctioned hunter who descends from the mountainous Xhacatocatl to harvest blood for his gods. Although his task appears to be sinister to any unwitting observer, he does all of his work in the name of his people and the twin gods they worship. The Flayed Twins require oceans of blood to keep themselves sated and pacified, but failure to fulfill their needs shall result in them draining all of Xhacatocatl's people. Thus he dons the mantle of the blood rite hunters to collect as much blood as possible, with his work made much easier thanks to the sacred markings of his gear that immediately channels the collected vital energies to the Twins.",
      "Strygwyr is the latest descendant of an ancient lineage of blood rite hunters who have also served the Flayed Twins in bygone times that no living being of the modern times can remember. In his youth, he served his blood hunter predecessors as a courier before he took on their mantle.",
      "In one of his travels, Strygwyr stumbled upon a strange benighted land that held executions over sacrifices. The killings that were offered to no one intrigued him for it was such a foreign concept to one who is accustomed to performing and receiving sacrifices. Before he could observe such fascinating customs, he needed to ensure that his visage and his identity were hidden to any suspicious bystanders. Hence he wears the local garbs of the land to blend in; including a hood a cape bracers and a skirt while fastening them with crude hempen rope from a noose that he found to be very useful. He also discarded his usual obsidian blades before heading out, until he managed to commission a pair of metal blades from the local blacksmith. Although he temporarily discarded his equipment that carries the sacred markings, he still relies on sacred lines of power to channel the blood he collects.",
      "Strygwyr spent an entire season studying this backward culture. He observed that the executioners of the gallows carried out their deeds with metal blades (guillotines) and hemp rope, decapitating and asphyxiating unlucky victims while a mob would watch their deaths with morbid fascination. He soon realized that the mob itself was a deity in disguise, and that the executions were actually sacrifices offered to it. Satisfied with his investigation, he departed for his homeland to share what he learned with his masters of Xhacatocatl's priestly caste.",
      "Strygwyr was mentioned in passing when  Dark Willow meets him as an ally. She says that she saw him at Roseleaf, but she kept her distance from him so that she wouldn't get killed. Cut Artifact card art shows that Strygwyr has been harvesting Oglodi for their blood, likely from the battles between Stonehall and the Red Mist in Roseleaf.",
      "He is also dispatched to sacrifice Prellex and Kanna, the two leaders of the Radiant and the Dire, respectively.",
      "Strygwyr respects those who have made themselves known for their reputation of death dealing and bloodshed, because their actions are indirect benefits to the Flayed Twins. This includes the likes of  Pudge  Luna  Necrophos and Sorla Khan.",
      "Strygwyr dislikes  Omniknight. He also acts on the will of his twin gods, who seek the Omniscience as sacrifice. He also dislikes  Chen and sees his faith in Obelis as a sad and empty thing.",
      "Acting on the will of the Flayed Twins, Strygwyr is hostile towards and dispatched to hunt demons who fear these gluttinous gods. Anessix is one of these demons hunted by their hound as seen in Dota Underlords. Eztzhok also attempted to possess Strygwyr, something that his twin gods did not take kindly to.",
      "Under his hood, Strygwyr has an eyeless face. He more than makes up for this handicap with a blessing from the Flayed Twins, who guide his vision with their own in the place of his nonexistent eyes.",
      "Strygwyr's original form is unknown, but over the years his appearance has drastically changed. In his current form, he has come to embody a houndlike being. In the process of him quenching his thirst with blood, the features of the Flayed Twins may manifest in his face and take direct possession of their hound. Eztzhok was also able to manifest his visage in Strygwyr's, but his influence was dispelled by the Flayed Twins nearly too late with great sacrifice on their part.",
      "Strygwyr's default garbs are imbued with sacred markings that allow him to channel the blood that he lets to the Twins. His default weapons, which are made of tough obsidian, are also imbued with these markings as well. Some of his equipment may be stained in the blood of the Twins themselves.",
      "He may be seen wearing armor adorned with the surprisingly durable feathers of a Hlotl beast. These feathers are said to offer benedictions to the wearer. This armor may even be adorned with the tusks and fangs of the great beasts native to Xhacatocatl.",
      "He once wore the primitive gear of the Bonehunters, a group of ferocious hunters living in the drylands. This bony equipment is worn alongside his default garbs which appear to be damaged and tattered. Speaking of bones, Strygwyr has access to a pair of heavy blades that are counterbalanced by a heavy portion of a prized red drake's spine.",
      "In some occasions, Strygwyr may take on the mantle of the Scarlet Raven. The garbs that he wears has a resemblance to the birds of prey who serve the Flayed Twins. While wearing these garbs, he is known as the Feathered One, flying towards his sacrifices (metaphorically) and striking at his prey with talon-like blades (literally) with an inhuman thirst for quivering heart-meat. He may also wear a headpiece that honors Iczoxtotec, the Herald of Blood. This great bird of prey is also bound to the Flayed Twins, soaring through the skies to search for sacrifice. When blood is shed in battle, the skies above will darken and herald the coming of this great raptor to the carnage.",
      "At some point in time, he was given a pair of demonic blades bearing the visage of Eztzhok. He wields these blades at the sight of his twin gods to share the blood he collects with the demon Eztzhok, which they do not approve of.",
      "Even without his sacred appurtenances, Strygwyr can channel the blood that he lets to his gods through sacred lines of power. The collected blood is not just given as tribute for the Flayed Twins, but also a source of self-healing. He can also absorb different kinds of vital energy, such as the essence that  Outworld Destroyer channels through his being. ",
      "Strygwyr's  Bloodrage allows him to bestow his animalistic thirst for bloodshed on others, making them just as vicious as the hound himself. When used on himself, it increases his own strength. Unused voice lines suggest that this skill, when cast on someone else, causes them to choke on blood. The blood inside their throat and mouth prevents them from speaking and reciting incantations aloud, hence the Silence debuff that it used to have. It is unknown if this ability still does that in the lore as it has long been reworked.",
      "Calling upon the power of the Flayed Twins themselves, Strygwyr performs a  Blood Rite on the battlefield. Once cast, Strygwyr will baptize the target area in the sacred blood of his twin gods, spattering the ground with a bloody symbol of the Flayed Twins' eye: a reminder that these enigmatic gods are always watching. Little to no information exists of how this ability harms its victims.",
      "When blood is shed, Strygwyr undergoes a  Thirst for blood. The faintest scent of blood is enough to send him into an animalistic frenzy, making him doggedly in the hunt for his victims. It's possible that Strygwyr can sense injured victims from far distances thanks to the Flayed Twins guiding him with their own vision.",
      "Although  Rupture has very little lore to describe what it does, it can probably be assumed that it works just like its gameplay counterpart. In that case, this ability will literally rupture an opponent, causing them to bleed with each step they take while affected by this power."

In whispered tones they say he was abandoned as a kit, learning his skill in tracking as a matter of simple survival. Others hear he was an orphan of war, taken in by the great Soruq the Hunter to learn the master's skill with a blade as they plumbed the dark forests for big game. Still others believe he was a lowly street urchin raised among a guild of cutpurses and thieves, trained in the arts of stealth and misdirection. Around campfires in the wild countryside his quarry speaks the rumors of Gondar's work, growing ever more fearful: they say it was he who tracked down the tyrant King Goff years after the mad regent went into hiding, delivering his head and scepter as proof. That it was he who infiltrated the rebel camps at Highseat, finally bringing the legendary thief White Cape to be judged for his crimes. And that it was he who ended the career of Soruq the Hunter, condemned as a criminal for killing the Prince's prized hellkite. The tales of Gondar's incredible skill stretch on, with each daring feat more unbelievable than the last, each target more elusive. For the right price, the hunted know, anyone can be found.

Born to a mother's flesh by a Celestial father, the youth known as Mangix was the first to grow up with the talents of both lineages. He trained with the greatest aesthetes of the Order, eventually earning, through diligent drunkenness, the right to challenge for the title of Brewmaster, that appellation most honored among the contemplative malt-brewing sect.As much drinking competition as mortal combat, Mangix for nine days drank and fought the elder master. For nine nights they stumbled and whirled, chugged and struck, until at last the elder warrior collapsed into a drunken stupor, and a new Brewmaster was named. Now the new, young Brewmaster calls upon the strength of his Oyo forebears to speed his staff. When using magic, it is to his spirit ancestors that he turns. Like all Brewmasters before him, he was sent out from his people with a single mission. He wanders the land, striving toward enlightenment through drink, searching for the answer to the ancient spiritual schism. Hoping to think the single thought that will unite the spirit and physical planes again."

Unlike other Celestials, however, Mangix is the only one attuned to more than one element. Because of this, he is able to split into three separate elemental warriors, although he may not be fully aware of this ability, as he is always inebriated when this split occurs. Mangix prefers alcoholic spirits, and disdains rum. He shares the same ancestors as  Storm Spirit,  Ember Spirit,  Void Spirit, and  Earth Spirit, and regards Storm Spirit as a cousin. The Ruined City is of particular importance to Mangix, where he hopes to return to one day, and be buried there."

Christened Bristleback by the drunken crowds, he waded into backroom brawls in every road tavern between Slom and Elze, until his exploits finally caught the eye of a barkeep in need of an enforcer. For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund).After indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match. \"Your tusks offend me, sir,\" he was heard to drunkenly slur to one particularly large fellow from the northern wastes whose bill had come due. What followed was a fight for the ages. A dozen fighters jumped in. No stool was left unbroken, and in the end, the impossible happened: the tab went unpaid. Over the weeks that followed, Bristleback's wounds healed, and his quills grew back; but an enforcer's honor can be a prickly thing. He paid the tab from his own coin, vowing to track down this northerner and extract redemption. And then he did something he'd never done before: he actually trained, and in so doing made a startling discovery about himself. A smile peeled back from his teeth as he flexed his quills. Turning his back to a fight might be just the thing."

In a later age, the Vizier of Greed, Ptholopthales, erected his lodestone ziggurat on the slopes of the dead volcano, knowing that any looters who sought his magnetic wealth must survive the spider-haunted passages.After millennia of maternal peace, Black Arachnia found herself beset by a steady trickle of furfeet and cutpurses, bold knights and noble youths--all of them delicious, certainly, and yet tending to create a less than nurturing environment for her innocent offspring. Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast.Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat's master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope. Broodmother headed for the surface, declaring her intent to rid the world of each and every possible invader, down to the last Hero if necessary, until she could ensure her nursery might once more be a safe and wholesome environment for her precious spiderspawn."

The cult of spiders has since disappeared, leaving only pieces of armor scattered across Broodmother's endless webs.",
      "Once, an unnamed blacksmith wandered into Black Arachnia's lair. Fearing for his life, he begged the Broodmother to spare him, and in return, he would craft her a set of armor. Black Arachnia agreed, and the blacksmith set about, measuring and forging a new set of spider armor, using metal collected from the discarded armor of knights who had fallen prey to the Broodmother. He completed eight spiked leg guards, each fashioned from the breastplate of a fallen knight. Then, with trembling hands, the blacksmith laid a metal headpiece on Black Arachnia's head, saying \"A crown fit for a queen\". Satisfied, Black Arachnia upheld her promise, and set the blacksmith free\u2013only to watch him be eaten alive by her spiderlings.",

      "It's said that a centaur's road is paved with the corpses of the fallen. For the one called Warrunner, it has been a long road indeed. To outsiders, the four-legged clans of Druud are often mistaken for simple, brutish creatures. Their language has no written form; their culture lacks pictographic traditions, structured music, formalized religion. For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self. If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist. He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites. As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action. Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length. It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor.Warrunner defeated warrior after warrior, until the arena boomed with the cheering of his name, and he found himself alone, the uncontested champion of his kind. The great belt of Omexe was bestowed, wrapped around his broad torso, but in his victory, the death-artist found only emptiness. For what is a warrior without a challenge? The great centaur galloped out of Omexe that day with a new goal. To his people, Warrunner is the greatest warrior to ever step into the arena. Now he has set out to prove he is the greatest fighter who has ever lived."

      "Bradwarden is the champion of the centaur race, having won his honor by killing every challenger in the arena of Omexe. Awarded the prestigious Great Belt of Omexe for his feat, Bradwarden commands respect, and fellow centaurs rally to join in him combat. Like other centaurs, Bradwarden believes combat to be the ultimate art form, likening swings of his blade to singing. He has accumulated at least a hundred victories in the arena, as evidenced by his Bloodrage Axe, taken from a vanquished warrior. As part of his duties, Bradwarden protects the Gloried Horn of Druud, a sacred relic that calls all centaurs to battle.",

Of all the ancient Fundamentals, he is the oldest and most tireless, endlessly searching out a being he knows only as \"The Light.\" Long ago the Light ventured out from the progenitor realm, in defiance of the first covenant. Now Chaos Knight shifts from plane to plane, always on the hunt to extinguish the Light wherever he finds it. A thousand times he has snuffed out the source, and always he slides into another plane to continue his search anew.Upon his steed Armageddon he rides, wading into battle with maniacal frenzy, drawing strength from the disorder of the universe. A physical manifestation of chaos itself, in times of need he calls upon other versions of himself from other planes, and together these dark horsemen ride into battle, as unstoppable as any force of nature. Only when the last Light of the world is scoured from existence will the search be ended. Where rides the Chaos Knight, death soon follows."

The other Fundamentals followed suit, prompting the Chaos Knight to reunite his escaped siblings.

Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen's clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan.In the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched. The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished\u2014or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen's obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward."

      "At the base of the Bleeding Hills stretches a thousand-league wood, a place called the Hoven, where black pools gather the tarry blood of the uplands, and the king-mage Sutherex sits in benevolent rule. Once a sworn protector of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a reputation for his skill with a bow. In the three-hundredth year of the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from Sixth Hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decreed an unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without End.Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle, defending his lands against the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz drove Maraxiform back to the gates of Sixth Hell itself, where on that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal conflict. Grievously wounded, the demon let out a blast of Hellfire as Clinkz loosed his final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as Hellfire poured out across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz alive at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving him in this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage, caught in the very act of dying, carrying Hell's breath with him on his journey into eternity."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Clinkz is reputed throughout the Hoven for his violent and volatile temper.",
      "Even in undeath, Clinkz's honor and loyalty to the Hoven persists. He dedicates his kills to the mage king Sutherex, and invokes the Hoven and its king while in battle. He still protects the Hoven, its people, and its ruler in spite of the pain that he feels just by existing.",
      "The very embodiment of the phrase \"No good deed goes unpunished\", Clinkz the Bone Fletcher is the damned protector of the Hoven lands, sentenced to an eternity of torment by a reward of infinite vitality that became the catalyst of his infinite suffering.",
      "Hailing from a vast forest kingdom called The Hoven, where pools of tar accumulate from the Bleeding Hills, Clinkz is a sworn protector of the Hoven lands and its king-mage Sutherex, protecting the forest kingdom with his recognized skills in archery. In the three-hundredth year of the immortal king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from Sixth Hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, Sutherex decreed an unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without End.",
      "Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded through the Hoven's tar pools to meet Maraxiform in battle. He successfully drove the demon back to its rift that lead to Sixth Hell where both combatants were locked in a mortal conflict. The wounded demon let out a blast of Hellfire just as Clinkz shot the final arrow that he will ever release as a mortal being. Both arrow and Hellfire found their target, killing Maraxiform and igniting the black pools across the land which burned Clinkz alive at the same time.",
      "The archer should have been incinerated were it not for him unwittingly fulfilling the spell's condition. The immortality spell was cast at the very moment when Clinkz was immolated and it preserved him before the Hellfire could consume his entire body. He survives now as a skeletal being of rage and agony, forced to feel the ever-burning Hellfire lapping his bones and his soul, neither Hellfire nor senescence being able to end his suffering.",
      "But Clinkz is not one to squander his boon-curse. In defiance of the pain that he feels, he continues to dedicate himself to the defense of the Hoven lands, patrolling all reaches of his beloved forest with one painful step after another and gifting Maraxiform's soul-fire to all who dare to make threats and carry them out against the Hoven.",
      "Despite his reputation for being quick to anger, he is still revered among the people of the Hoven. He unknowingly reciprocates their respect by keeping the Hoven lands safe from harm.",
      "Clinkz carries a bow made of the bony remains of his grandfather, likely as a way to honor him. Using the bow as a medium, he often gives Clinkz unwanted advice.",
      "Snapfire trusts Clinkz to keep her secret cookie recipe and tells him to never reveal it until she's gone.",
      "The source of Clinkz's immortality and suffering, this spell was first decreed by the king-mage Sutherex as a reward (and an incentive) for anyone who could kill Maraxiform. The spell is cast and activated by a strange geas, but without the restricting magic. Upon fulfilling the spell's conditions, the immortality spell will be bestowed upon the entity who fulfilled it. The spell is said to be unbreakable, but what this means in practice is unknown.",
      "Life Without End grants eternal life beyond mere longevity to its recipient. In addition to that, it seems that being under this spell allows the user to be resurrected by Sutherex should they be killed. The circumstances surrounding the spell's activation during Clinkz's demise has placed his own existence between the brink of life and death. The spell is said to come from Sutherex's bond of life and death, which allowed Clinkz to exploit this spell's properties and gain new ways of using his immortality beyond its intended use.",
      "His immortality keeps him from being claimed by Maraxiform. It's possible that if he dies permanently, Maraxiform will finally claim him and drag him back to Sixth Hell.",
      "Fitting for his Bone Fletcher moniker, Clinkz's weapon of choice is an unorthodox shaped bow crafted from sharp bone. No ordinary bow, it lacks a physical bowstring and instead uses a stream of Hellfire emanating from the tip of its limbs that only appears when he draws it back and loads it with an arrow. His bony arrows have a long shaft that slightly dwarfs his short stature.",
      "Aside from his default bow, Clinkz owns a variety of bows made from the remains of beings before him. He has a bow brought back from Hell itself, a recurve bow attached with the vertebrae of the fallen damned, a bow made from the preserved bones of his grandfather that is imbued with spirit fire, and a bow made of bone and steel that's inscribed with runes of a lost language that can corrupt anyone who manages to read them, provided that they can understand it in the first place. Most of his bows have sharp pointy ends that he can use as a makeshift melee weapon should he run out of ammunition.",
      "None of these bows are as wicked as Maraxiform's head, which he has fashioned into a bow. As punishment for condemning Clinkz to the indignities of eternal torment, he has made the demon's expired visage into a bow so that both of them will witness Clinkz's suffering together, unable to look away as he carries it with him forever.",
      "Clinkz wears a set of enchanted armor that was forged by blind smeevils a long time ago. The armor represents a vague demonic being known as the Vandal. It includes the Demon Guise, an iron mask to hide one's identity, the claw of the Vandal, and an enchanted pair of shoulder armor. It also comes with a quiver that's said to have an endless supply of arrows.",
      "Clinkz may keep his arrows in a furnace brimming with Maraxiform's fire, which he carries on his back like a quiver.",
      "Clinkz's powers are a combination of his archery skills, his newfound power over demon fire, and exploitations of his immortality spell: Life Without End.",
      "The Bone Fletcher's speed with the bow allows him to unleash a  Burning Barrage of arrows to turn his enemies into oversized pincushions, or if he has lit his arrows beforehand, into cremated remains.",
      "By lighting his arrows with Maraxiform's soul-fire, Clinkz can fire  Searing Arrows from his bow, bringing the same torrid fate that he survived to his enemies. The way he transfers his Hellfire to his arrows in the quick of battle is ambiguous, something Windranger is curious about.",
      "Skeleton Walk complements Clinkz's ambush tactics as an archer. Upon activation, Clinkz turns invisible as a burst of fire and a puff of smoke cover his disappearance.",
      "Burning Army is a good example of Clinkz exploiting his undead state as a source of power. Clinkz's restorative immortality and consuming Hellfire has balanced him on the brink of life and death, turning him into an undead who is not so alive or dead. He has learned how to temporarily bridge the gap between them both to perform necromancy and reanimate a group of fiery skeletal archers to his side.",
      "Death Pact is the king-mage's Life Without End spell used in a more offensive way. Having assimilated the spell that preserved him into his being, Clinkz taps into Sutherex's bond of life and death to re-enact his pact on lesser beings, restoring his health at the cost of stealing the life of an unlucky sacrifice."

     "Intro": [
      "Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older sister Lina, Rylai the Crystal Maiden soon found that her innate elemental affinity to ice created trouble for all those around her. Wellsprings and mountain rivers froze in moments if she stopped to rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten by frost, and fruiting orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing down, spoiled. When their exasperated parents packed Lina off to the equator, Rylai found herself banished to the cold northern realm of Icewrack, where she was taken in by an Ice Wizard who had carved himself a hermitage at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After long study, the wizard pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her to take his place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand years. Her mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that time, and now her skills are unmatched."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Rylai wore pigtails during her youth.",
      "Rylai is  Lina's younger sister, with whom she shares a sibling rivalry. According to Rylai, she was always the \"good one\". The two sisters destroyed their parent's house six times, through fire and ice.",
      "Rylai once considered becoming an artificer of magical goods, and crafted many wards as practice.",
      "Rylai is sometimes known as the Maiden of the North.",
      "Rylai is able to channel winds from the Blueheart Glacier, where she currently resides.",
      "Rylai is able to summon shards of ice from Icewrack.",
      "Rylai's ability to lower the temperature of her surroundings causes magic to flourish nearby.",
      "Rylai does not like outward displays of force.",
      "Rylai knew  Tusk in her youth, and used to have snowball fights with him.",
      "Like her mentor, the Ice Wizard, Rylai plans to return to Blueheart Glacier someday, and hibernate for a thousand years.",
      "Rylai knows Pierpont, a Sapphire Archon who appears to have been her mentor. It is unknown whether or not Pierpont is the same person as the Ice Wizard.",
      "According to Mireska, it was their parents that drove Lina and Rylai apart.",
      "Rylai received a feather-like robe and staff from the Ice Wizard before he descended into the glacier.",
      "Rylai owns the mantle and crown of Yulsaria, the Frozen Witch.",
      "Rylai has had contact with the Frostiron Tribe.",
      "Rylai has likely been to Wolfsden Tavern, and owns a hat from there as a souvenir.",
      "Rylai is known as the \"Warden of Icewrack\".",
      "According to the Father of Dragon Hold, Rylai posses some features of a water dragon.",
      "Rylai later saves Kaden, Fymwryn, Bram and Davion from Terrorblade.",
      "Rylai is talkative.",
      "Rylai doesn't take good care of herself.",
      "Rylai may be a little crazy.",
      "Rylai is brave but lacks wisdom.",
      "In her youth, Rylai once angered her master, the Ice Wizard, forcing her to exile herself to the Boiling Sea, where the Blueheart Glacier met the ocean. She spent months in meditation, seeking ways to prove herself worthy again of his tutelage. One afternoon, she awoke to speak a single word: \"Snowdrop\". And with that one word, she caused her surroundings to freeze, turning the steam into falling snow. When she returned to the Blueheart Glacier, she was greeted by the Ice Wizard, who had learned of her magical deed, and was impressed. As a reward, he gifted her a new outfit, to serve as proof of her mastery over the elemental ice.",
      "Lina is Rylai's primary rival, and the two siblings feuded often in their childhood. In the past, Lina appears to have done her sister a great wrong, and is now living in guilt. After having spoken with Lina, Dont\u00e9 Panlin may have gotten her to concede remorse. Acting as a middleman, he relays this information to Rylai, telling her that Lina may be ready to make amends.",
      "Unbeknownst to her, Kaldr has a crush on Rylai, and wishes to ask her out on date."

     "Intro": [
      "Children love telling stories about the whimsical adventures of fairies... That's because children don't know that most fairies are spiteful jerks. And in the world of spiteful fairies there are few names spoken of with more contempt than Mireska Sunbreeze.Born to a fae merchant king, Mireska grew up in Revtel; a cutthroat nation where manipulation and murder were the norm. But while she was quite adept at navigating the etiquette, unspoken laws, and social rituals that permeated every element of her life, she found the whole thing rather boring.So, Mireska did what most rebellious children do: burn down her family estate and set off with her pet wisp Jex to live the life of a wandering grifter."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Mireska Sunbreeze is a Fae, and the daughter of one of Revtel's merchant kings. Like the other members of her kind, she is a devious character, scheming endlessly to come up with the next con. She loathes her family and strives for independence, seeking to make her name known to the world and forever remembered by her family. Versed in magic and able to slip into the Fae Realm at any moment, Mireska uses her abilities for mischief and harm. She has contempt for naive do-gooders, and great lust for gold and treasure. Despite her sadistic nature, she does not relish violence, and only resorts to it to attain her goals. Instead, she admires talent and trickery, and enjoys turning rivals against one another. Mireska is always accompanied by Jex, an equally sinister wisp that she keeps as her companion.",
      "Born into a privileged house in Revtel, Mireska was a wealthy girl with many advantages, including tutors, whom she hated. Her father, one of the city's rulers, had an overbearing personality, judging her and gloating over her failures as well as lecturing her about the dangers of the outside world. She learned to navigate the complex rituals and etiquette of Fae society, but grew weary of them, and decided to cast them aside to forge her own destiny. Bored of Revtel and fed up with its tyrannical government, she burnt her family estate to the ground and stole the family birthright.",
      "After having fled the city with Jex, Mireska assumed a life of travel, returning occasionally to the wooded hollow where she keeps her stolen goods. The price of her independence is steep, however, and Mireska now finds herself wanted in six nations, hunted by assassins wherever she goes. Guided by ley lines, she never stays in one place too long, preferring to wander the world in search of victims to fleece.",
      "Wanted for her crimes in Revtel, Mireska is hunted by assassins of all backgrounds, none of which have been sucessful so far. Perhaps due to her potent magical abilities, she is wanted by the Tyler Estate, and sought after by its agents Nortrom and Anti-Mage. Her father also wants her brought back to face her crimes, and has hired the bounty hunter Gondar to find her. Special Fae stalkers have been employed to trail her. Due to these circumstances, Mireska has grown paranoid of being captured or killed.",
      "Although Mireska found her father's behavior insufferable, some would argue that her own actions are no different.",
      "In her early travels, Mireska met Lorlin Lasan, a member of the Jasper Circle who taught her how to kill. Eventually, she was asked to join the Jasper Circle, but turned down the offer because she did not want to perform deeds for the organization, and also because she found their professional approach to ethics unbearable. Nonetheless, she retains some knowledge of the Jasper Circle's dealings, warning her friend Meepo that he is being hunted by the organization.",
      "She has spent much time in Iron Fog, where she witnessed machines and horrors inflicted on people. Her purpose there remains unknown. The trading center of Weeping Rose was another one of her frequented places, until she was kicked out for an unknown reason.",
      "Mireska's journeys take her across the world, to places like Quoidge and the remote Yama Raskav Jungle. She has been to Roseleaf, where a clash between the Bronze Legion and the Red Mist army occurred, with Mireska being at the site during or after the fight. There, she found the Bullsnake Flag, although to whom it belongs is a mystery. She has also been to the arid lands far to the southeast of Roseleaf, which she adored.",
      "Stowing away on one of Kunkka's ships, Mireska was present at the Trembling Isle when the battle raged between the Claddish Navy and the Demons of the Cataract. Her reason for being on the boat is unclear, but she may have been searching for a trophy of some sort. To what extent she was involved in the battle is unknown, but it appears that she did something to doom the Claddish Navy, for which she is now loathed and hunted by Kunkka. Mireska was traumatized by the battle, and blames the events of that day on Tidehunter.",
      "In an attempt to find lost relics, Mireska journeyed to the Fellstrath jungles, where she discovered the ruins of the Overgrown Empire. In doing so, she awakened the Mo'rokai, a pair of magical beasts once worshiped by the inhabitants of that lost civilization. The Mo'rokai went on a rampage through the jungle, seeking to the destroy the Ancients.",
      "Raised in the unscrupulous society of Revtel, Mireska is prone to stealing things for pleasure, greed and revenge. Upon leaving, she stole her family's prized heirloom, knowing it would anger her father greatly. She lusts after gold and jewelry, going so far as to ask Rylai if she could put her in touch with a Sapphire Archon, possibly to steal some sapphires for herself. From Darkterror she stole the Claszureme Hourglass, an arcane relic that controls time. She has looted Undying's grave, taking with her valuable burial items and refusing to return them. Mireska has also contemplated arson.",
      "Having been kicked out of Weeping Rose, Mireska now plots to return and rob the trading hub. She also has her eyes set on the Apotheosis Blade, vowing to Jex that she will steal it one day. The sacred mists from the Font of Avernus is also on her list. According to Inai, Mireska is looking for the Shadowgate Amulet, though he warns her that using it comes with a heavy toll.",
      "Aside from material goods, Mireska also covets arcane secrets. She flatters Enigma, hoping to learn about his powers. The secrets of Aghanim, Rubick's father, are also highly desired by Mireska, who believes the answer lies in his shifting staff.",
      "On the less criminal side of things, Mireska is fond of drinking, frequenting pubs and tallying up large tabs. She also enjoys gambling and betting on the courier races at White Spire.",
      "Mireska is good friends with Meepo, inviting him to the race tracks and going to taverns with him. When she hears that the Jasper Circle is out to find Meepo over an unsettled debt, she warns him beforehand. Because of her love of drink, Mireska is also friendly towards Mangix, getting drunk with him and praising him at his job.",
      "Rhasta has a working relationship with her, and she has a degree of professional respect for his conman background. Once, when Mireska and Rhasta ran scams in the same city, their overlapping schemes caused much trouble for both of them. So, Mireska plans to come up with a schedule regarding which cities they should travel to at what time, so that their cons don't interfere with one another.",
      "Riki seems to have parted ways with Mireska, deciding to join the Jasper Circle while she did not. Mireska believes that had they not gone their separate ways, they could have been friends.",
      "Donte Panlin seems to have known Mireska since her childhood. Even today, he tries to warn and dissuade her from continuing down the path of crime, telling her that she could have a good life as a heroic figure. His sympathy for her is revealed when he asks Gondar to spare Mireska, and not rob her of her future by bringing her back to her father. For her part, Mireska finds Donte's lectures irritating, and openly despises him.",
      "Mireska is unkind towards Ostarion and Tresdin, whom she regard as tyrannical leaders akin to the kings of Revtel. She frowns on Stonehall and its bloody battles, and warns Tresdin that Rix will kill her. Mireska also despises a Keen named Mazzie, although the exact reasoning is unknown. When it comes to demons, Mireska avoids their enticements altogether, possibly because her father warned her against dealing with demons long ago. The Faerie Dragon Puck possess similar powers as the Fae, and he constantly interferes in her activities, provoking anger from Mireska. Like Puck, she is one of the few who can understand Mercurial.",
      "The Vigil Knights have fought or attempted to subdue Mireska before, for reasons unknown. Due to the events that occurred at the Trembling Isle, Mireska is on the run from Kunkka, and has a hostile relationship with Tidehunter."

      "In the aeons after the Keeper's exodus birthed the age of light, some amongst the first sun's lineage began to align against the chaos their ancestor's maker left chasing in his wake. Calling themselves the Children of Light, they saw no one else as worthy of taking up the Keeper's abandoned mantle, and they yearned to beat back the onslaught of darkness, creating glorious armies built to purge the cosmos of all creatures of primordial night.Valora, the Dawnbreaker, most prized warrior amongst the Children's ancient creations, is the shining herald of the majesty of order and light. Molded from the heart of a young metallic star, and charged by golden breath with new life, Valora was called to spread the glow of the Children's wisdom to the darkest reaches of the universe \u2014 setting fire to the heavens with each swing of her celestial hammer amidst an endless battle to keep chaos at bay.In time, the Children also revealed another purpose for the Dawnbreaker. They had discovered a means of permeating the entirety of the cosmos with their inner light \u2014 to obliterate all aspects of darkness forever \u2014 and they sent Valora to seize a source of great power, the final piece of their ultimate plan. But for the first time, Valora and her hammer met with failure, and the price she and her masters paid was vast. The Children of Light's spark was utterly extinguished, and the Dawnbreaker was left adrift in a black expanse, lost for untold millennia before crashing on an unfamiliar world.There she rested, dormant, until the presence of a wandering young star gave fuel to an ancient energy forge \u2014 a relic of the Children's that, like her, lay buried for countless ages beneath a blowing red waste. Now, with a small measure of her former powers restored by the forge, Valora wakes to a land beset by war and the unrelenting forces of chaos. She knows her gods may be gone, but the heft of the Dawnbreaker's hammer remains \u2014 matched only by her will to wield it justly in the name of goodness and light."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Hailing from a time where powerful, ancient beings were once commonplace, Valora looks down on the world that she sees nowadays, seeing its inhabitants as weak and lesser things. She doesn't relate with the mortals and modern gods that she meets, because she has been around much longer than them with her expansive perspective on existence and greater combat experience with creatures and entities much more powerful than the ones today.",
      "Phoenix carries an echo of the Children's spark within him, which means that they were his solar ancestors, and that Phoenix and Dawnbreaker are connected on a deeper level of familial ties.",
      "This process seems to be the same ability that cosmic entities like Enigma utilize to reform their existence. She doesn't seem to use it like them, however, only being able to manipulate order and chaos via mundane combat.",
      "Valora the Dawnbreaker is the living weapon of the Children of Light, forged from the purest elements of a young star and infused with the essence of her gods' breath. Entrusted with and inseparable from the Brightmaul that once lit the darkness of space with celestial flame, this shining automaton is compelled to see to the tasks of her creators who had wished to continue the Bright Rider's quest against darkness and chaos, while spreading their inner glow to the very ends of the cosmos.",
      "A great tragedy soon befell Valora and her masters, leaving her virtually lifeless and inert in the cold black space between the stars and the planets. Her uncontrolled course through space brought her into the planet where the Nemesis Stones crashed upon, laying dormant for aeons until a star in the far reaches of space revived her with its spark. She rises now from her dark sleep to witness an unfamiliar world beset by the same chaos that her masters yearned to oppose.",
      "After many years of inactivity, the stakes of the fight before her have not changed, and so she wields her Brightmaul once more to bend chaos to order and shine brightly upon the darkness, honoring the memory of her beloved masters.",
      "Among the progeny of the Keeper's first sun, there was the Children of Light, a constellation among the many stars born from the crucible of its supernova who bore witness to a world beset by the chaos that chased after their ancestor's maker. Taking up the Keeper's abandoned mantle, they continued his work in bringing light and order to the realm, while establishing their own goals to purge the cosmos of every creature of darkness.",
      "To aid them in their endless endeavors, they molded a warrior from the elements in the heart of a young star and animated it with their golden breath. This golem would soon be known as Valora, the Dawnbreaker, who would become the sole owner of the Brightmaul, a hammer capable of lighting the dark vacuum of space with celestial fire. The shining herald of the majesty of order and light, Valora's sole calling was to join the Children in spreading their glow to the darkest corners of the universe, initially oblivious to her own sense of self.",
      "Although the Children of Light's goals of spreading light seemed righteous, there were some among the vast lineage of stars who refused to align with them and rebelled. True to their dedication to order, the Children sent their enforcer Valora to break the opposition\u2014either by destroying them or intimidating them with a demonstration of their power to join their cause. Time after time, she was tasked with more missions, each one more daunting than the last.",
      "One such task was the purging of the creatures of primordial night, of which Balanar was once a member of. On the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures perished save for the one we know as Balanar. She also joined Ares in a century long campaign against the forces of The Continuum, which resulted in Ares' and Valora's forces toppling them.",
      "None of these missions were as daring and high-stake as their final mission to obliterate all aspects of darkness and chaos forever. In spite of the foreknowledge that their failure was invincible should they choose to partake in it, they dispatched Valora to seize an unobtainable power to bind chaos forever\u2014the power of a Fundamental, whose charge binds all of existence together.",
      "For the first time in her ageless life, Valora and her hammer finally met with failure. The spark within her masters was obliterated, and Valora, having a life link connected to them, shared the same fate for her complicity on their attack against Io. Without the Children's spark to animate her body, she was left adrift in the vacuum of space as she faded into a dark sleep for untold aeons, until her aimless course was caught in the pull of an unfamiliar world.",
      "Somewhere in the cosmos, the star that gave the form of Valora had turned into a cold neutron star. This star was among the many things that were left abandoned by the late Children of Light, such as the abandoned solar energy forge of the Children that was buried beneath a blowing red waste (possibly a nebula given the description) somewhere deep in the cosmos. A young wandering star who inherited the spark of her masters gave it fuel to ignite its spark once more, bringing the Dawnbreaker back on the verge of consciousness and restoring an infinitesimal portion of her former powers.",
      "But Valora did not fully awaken just yet. Even after she reestablished a link to her old source of life, she still did not arise from her slumber, spending her time in the darkness of sleep dwelling on her failures and lamenting the loss of her masters. But she would soon realize that the world could still use her light, and she woke up to a world beset by the chaos her creators attempted to stop. With the Brightmaul in her hands to accompany her in this unfamiliar world, she wields her newfound powers to finish what her masters started.",
      "Valora belongs to a vast lineage of stars dating back to the first sun to ever exist in the universe, created by their great grandfather  Keeper of the Light. The progeny of this sun included her creators the Children of Light, who forged her body from the elements of a young star's core and gave her life with their golden breath. As their most powerful enforcer, she carried out their tasks without question, which would soon cost both of their lives in their final mission. After deep reflection on the things she did in service to her masters, she feels regretful on what they made her do, but continues to honor their memory.",
      "The Solar Goddess is a descendant branched from the lineage of the children of the Keeper's first sun, hinting at a very distant connection between  Lina and her goddess with Valora's kin.",
      "Towards Ezalor, she has many mixed feelings. While humbled by the presence of the creator of all her creators, she expresses her regret about Ezalor not remembering things, like the grim fate of the Golden Lords (who were his descendants) and him not knowing how to \"set this all to rights\", indicating something wrong with their lives. She is also angry at him for abandoning his descendants.",
      "Eons after being put out of commission, Valora was infused with new life when the light of  Phoenix ignited an ancient Solar Forge that gave her new life. Because of this, she is grateful to the young star who revived her. This gift of life has stimulated in her a deep respect for Phoenix that she would have regarded the young star as her master, were she still bound to such concepts.",
      "In an unknown point in time, long before she was made dormant, she used to be lovers with  Mars back when he was still known as Ares. Together, they toppled the Continuum in a campaign that lasted for centuries. They broke up soon after for unknown reasons. To Mars, he calls her by the name Valor.",
      "As an ancient being, Valora seems to be quite familiar with a number of other ancient beings like herself: gods, eldritch creatures, ancient beings, etc. Before her decommission, she lived in a time where ancient beings were commonplace, hence her familiarity with these entities.",
      "For the gods and deities that she is familiar with, Valora seems to know who the Dead God is, having known him before he was killed. She remembers  Void Spirit in a time before he took on a form that made him look old, but never met him personally. She is one of the few who seems to have partial knowledge on what the Omniscience really is. She also knows  Enigma.",
      "Valora seems to be oblivious to the fact that  Outworld Destroyer is the last of his kind, hinting that she knew his race before they dwindled in numbers. On the other hand, she seems to know the people of Claszureme and the Weavers, two extradimensional beings beyond time.",
      "Her masters have connections with  Morphling's master, and they almost agreed to help his furious master find the missing elemental until more pressing issues arose, forcing them to drop the matter.",
      "Valora was made to see to the goals of the Children of Light. That includes purging the universe of every creature of darkness, which includes the likes of  Night Stalker. But her and her masters' true enemy was the  Chaos Knight, who they sought to bind as part of their master plan. They dispatched Valora to seize the power of  Io so that they may use it to bind the chaos, but Io retaliated by extinguishing the spark of both her and the Children.",
      "In the first moments of her reawakening on the planet where the Nemesis Stones crashed upon, she wanted nothing more than to take revenge on Io for destroying her masters. She has sought absolution after pondering on her masters' true motives and no longer bears any negative feelings towards Io for their demise.",
      "Valora's body is forged out of celestial materials\u2014the purest elements found in the metal-rich core of a young star. This empty metal shell was animated by the breath of its creators, forming the life essence that came to be known as Valora. Before her demise, she drew endless life and power only from the spark of the Children, an irreplaceable source of energy that no other star can provide, much like the compatibility between a blood donor and a blood recipient.",
      "Although she had lost her very source of life and power, she would soon find the same source of light once again from an ancient solar forge that also belonged to the late Children of Light, which came to life when it was ignited by a young star that inherited the same spark of the Children. She returned to life in a vastly weakened state with most of her powers restricted due to the young star's spark being diluted by the dwindling power of his lineage, but what matters to her the most is that she has found her long-lost life again.",
      "Valora implies that she once had the ability to see through invisibility before she lost her masters' spark.",
      "Besides its effects in gameplay,  Starbreaker doesn't have much lore to it since it's just a simple hammer technique.",
      "Celestial Hammer demonstrates the strong bond between Valora and the Brightmaul, allowing her to recall the hammer to her hands whenever it leaves her grasp. The trails of fire left in its wake is but a shadow of what it used to do under the spark of the Children, back when it was able to light the cosmos with its heft.",
      "Luminosity is an interesting metaphysical ability. She can create \"order\" from the \"chaos\" that resides in each battle to recharge herself and nearby allies who are in the battle with her, restoring their essence at the cost of her enemy's.",
      "Solar Guardian is a mere remnant of her restricted ability to fly through space at the speed of light. In her weakened state, she can no longer afford cosmic flight as a luxury, so she uses this sparingly and only in defense of her allies who may beckon her during times of need."

The final rite, the rite of shades, is a harrowing spiritual journey through the Nothl Realm, an unpredictable domain from which not all visitants return.  Of those who do, some return mad. Others return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their experiences.Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented. Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of his tribe danced through the night.In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil; and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy. Now he uses his gift to cut down his enemies and mend his friends."

But after years of inquiring on behalf of others, she began to seek clues on her own fate. When death refused to yield its secrets, she tried to buy them with her life. But the ultimate price proved insufficient.Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity\u2014why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged.Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin.. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more."

But sometimes, other spirits or entities can be summoned by her, such as ethereal bats, moths, or even wild spirits that she may have encountered during her time spent in the afterlife.",
      "She may have lost her sight for perhaps peering too far into her prophecies.",
      "She appears to still have a very dim spark of life within herself, which is still bright enough to attract shades and other creatures in the realms of death that she visits.",
      "So frequent were her attempts to cross the veil of death that souls of those who have recently died, both remnant and whole, have clung to her in an attempt to be brought back with her. These attempts have resulted in them being turned into a rather grotesque dress. Whether or not it was against their will is unknown.",

Constantly under assault from both seasonal storms and encroachment from civilized kingdoms to the South, the upland Oglodi have for centuries struggled to subsist atop the endless tablelands. They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization, a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand. For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life. But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake.Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity. As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities, searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories. He took what he needed and returned to his tribe. Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes. Part magic, part craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and death\u2014a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South, and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands."

      "After years on the trail of a legendary Eldwurm, the Knight Davion found himself facing a disappointing foe: the dreaded Slyrak had grown ancient and frail, its wings tattered, its few remaining scales stricken with scale-rot, its fangs ground to nubs, and its fire-gouts no more threatening than a pack of wet matchsticks.Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, Knight Davion prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that Davion might honor him with death in combat. Davion agreed, and found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon pierced Davion's throat with a talon. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight. The dragon's death sealed their bond and Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the Dragon Knight Davion, waking when he calls it. Or perhaps it is the Dragon that calls the Knight\u2026"

      "Knight Davion is known to show mercy to foes that he believes have suffered enough, although his mercy comes in the form of death.",
      "As mentioned earlier, Sir Davion is a valorous knight with his strong heart, whose formidable bravery and honor persists until he has perished.",
      "When he is given a new life after death, Davion uses it as an opportunity to redeem his honor and prove his own valor.",
      "Some of his armor is forged from dragon remains to posthumously honor these beasts who have died in battle. Wearing such armor to battle is considered an honor.",
      "Because of the above qualities, some Heroes call Sir Davion a do-gooder. Lyralei states that Davion is a kind person.",
      "Even when he isn't a dragon, Davion feels inclined to collect gold for his hoard. In rare occasions, he may spend the gold on something equally valuable.",
      "He inherits the immense self-respect of dragons as he dislikes turning into a dragon to let others ride him in that form, since dragons dislike being debased to mounts.",
      "Infused with Slyrak's own blood, Sir Davion inherits centuries' worth of wisdom from the Eldwurms, including skills said to be beyond mortal knowledge.",
      "Davion has a saying about war: \u201cSteel wins battles, gold wins wars.\u201d This could mean that battles are won with soldiers, but larger scale conflicts are won with money.",
      "Despite the above saying about the power of money, Sir Davion believes that money is useless in the afterlife.",
      "According to Davion, victory is inherent in strength. He could simply be saying that strength is a guarantee for victory.",
      "Sir Davion achieving mastery over dragons during battle would not be possible were it not for him achieving mastery of his self.",
      "Well armored though he may be, Davion is truly protected not by his plates, but rather by his faith, perhaps placed on his own success or the abilities he uses to achieve it.",
      "The Dragon Knight may wield a blade sharp enough to cut through the toughest scales and hide, but it is nothing to the sharpness of his mind when he fights dragons.",
      "With the unusually magic-rich blood of Slyrak whose effects are magnified and distorted, Davion can draw strength and transformative power not only from Slyrak alone but also from the oldest ancestral strains of dragon, such as the  Iron Dragons.",
      "When meeting Sir Davion,  Morphling will compare himself to the former, saying that both of them are \"always changing\". He might be referring to Davion's transformative power and how it's not limited to just one dragon form, just like Morphling's unlimited forms. This may further explain the various forms and powers that Slyrak might have when he springs forth from Davion.",
      "Davion is the Dragon Knight, a title that represents both his occupation and his dual nature. A seasoned warrior of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian, Sir Davion is best known for being the one chosen vessel of Slyrak's essence, enhancing his knightly skills with a dragon's strength and granting him the powers of an elder dragon.",
      "When Davion dies in battle, he will blame Slyrak with his last breath for failing him.",
      "Sylla states that Davion is of Dragon Clan. He may have made the assumption from his dragon-attuned shapeshifting, like himself being from Bear Clan as a bear shapeshifter.",
      "Through the Blood Route, Davion is infused with centuries' worth of wisdom from the Eldwurms. He has some sort of kinship with the Eldwurms, since he joins them in death.",
      "A fellow eldwurm,  Winter Wyvern is familiar with Slyrak and thinks Davion is nothing like him. She implies he or they did something wrong, which she brings retribution to.",
      "In all his aeons,  Chaos Knight claims he has never seen a knight like Davion. Regardless, he finds him worthy of his plates and his respect, but mocks his lack of a steed.",
      "As allies,  Omniknight appreciates Sir Davion's assistance in battle, but as enemies, Purist believes that Slyrak and his blood are impurities on Davion's body and thus his soul.",
      "Asan implies that Davion is an orphan when he says their shared orphanhood won't make them allies, just like his counterpart in the animated series.",
      "Asan finds Davion formidable in both his knight form and dragon form. Hence, he invites him to kill some assassins from the corrupted Sisters of the Veil.",
      "Dawnbreaker has heard of Davion's ironic failure with killing Slyrak and is curious about his fellow Dragon Knights' response to it.",
      "Siltbreaker doesn't find the legendary Dragon Knight impressive, but thinks otherwise about the mighty Eldwurm dwelling inside him.",
      "Ursa recognizes the power that was given to the Dragon Knight, telling him that he is squandering this great gift if he dies.",
      "Void Spirit conveys his respect to the ancient power of Slyrak that inhabits Davion's being, although only after beating him in battle.",
      "Lycan believes that shapeshifters like him and Davion should stick together.",
      "Another shapeshifter known as the  Lone Druid is pleased to see Davion of Dragon Clan, but does not suffer them standing against him.",
      "The demon marauder  Terrorblade appreciates having dragon allies by his side, including Sir Davion and Slyrak within him.",
      "Bristleback hates knights, including Davion.",
      "In Dota Underlords,  Lich has eagerly anticipated his fight with Slyrak for a long time. This may be linked to a plot where he did something wrong to Auroth, a fellow Eldwurm.",
      "Sir Davion punishes  Lina for enslaving dragons, which could be a reference to her  Dragon Slave. He humbles her on her lesser knowledge of dragons.",
      "Apparently, someone told  Pudge that Davion's title is a \u201cdouble entr\u00e9e\u201d which he shares to him. He probably made that up to tell him that he's going have a taste.",
      "Sir Davion possesses a crimson sword forged from the grand dragon Vyxia's scales and teeth. The edge of its blade is stained and heated by her fiery blood on it.",
      "Among Davion's swords is the Ember Edge. Its blade perpetually glows from an unknown heat and thus it is said to be a source of warmth and a beacon in the darkness.",
      "Davion owns a big and heavy shield that is made from dragon-forged steel which he brings to war.",
      "It is mentioned in passing that Davion is ageless. It's implied Slyrak can resurrect through unknown means after Davion's death, but no such luck for the knight.",
      "A simple but devastating gift from Slyrak's transfusion, Davion inherits his power to  Breathe Fire, capable of scorching knights, lesser dragons, and icy empires alike.",
      "In spite of these terrifying and legendary feats of Slyrak's infernal exhalation, it's unknown if the Eldwurm's natural abilities are diluted in the lesser body of Sir Davion or not.",
      "With the shield of Slyrak, Knight Davion viciously smites foes with the strength of a  Dragon Tail, a combination of Slyrak's talents and his knightly skill.",
      "The heat of Davion's resolve is so powerful that it briefly combines the elemental and terrene planes as one, harnessing the element of flame as a result.",
      "The source of his draconic power, Slyrak's  Dragon Blood flows through Davion's veins, imbuing him with twice the vitality of an ordinary knight and transformative power.",
      "Fireball has no special lore whatsoever.",
      "Slyrak lies asleep within Sir Davion until the knight calls to him, while Sir Davion waits within Slyrak until the Eldwurm calls him. Davion warns against awakening them both, which can provoke an unknown but terrifying consequence."

Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people.After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all,  her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers.Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart."

In restless slumbers, encased in a deep seam of stone, he became aware of the life drifting freely above him. He grew curious.During a season of tremors, the peaks of Nishai shook themselves loose of avalanches, shifting the course of rivers and turning shallow valleys into bottomless chasms. When the land finally ceased quaking, Earthshaker stepped from the settling dust, tossing aside massive boulders as if throwing off a light blanket.He had shaped himself in the image of a mortal beast, and named himself Raigor Stonehoof. He bleeds now, and breathes, and therefore he can die. But his spirit is still that of the earth; he carries its power in the magical totem that never leaves him. And on the day he returns to dust, the earth will greet him as a prodigal son."

A fragment from that planet has now merged with Earthshaker, and its power is re-awakening inside him. Having defeating one \"interstellar traveler\" who sought to destroy the remnants of his sister earth, he is now on the lookout for future attacks. At the same time, he seeks to understand how the sister earth was destroyed, and one day avenge her passing. In the mean time, he uses the fragment from his sister earth as a totem.",

Intending to cross into space and meet the entity, he asks Io about relocation, and Zet about traveling through the cosmos.",

Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting. And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred. In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable.The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten. Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan."

Reciting a summoning incantation from Elze, he brought Enigma into the material plane.

Such was its power that it would kill Cedric if he were to wear it in his current form, but not as a Fundamental. To control this power safely, he needed to complete the spell that will turn him into a Fundamental. And only Enigma has the answers to the mystery that would make Cedric into a god like him.",

Cedric refused and reiterated to him that he is still under his heel, but Enigma reveals that he was never affected by Cedric's spells and casually walks through the forcefield. As he slowly approaches the terrified alchemist, he taunts him about his foolishness and fulfills his wishes in an ironic manner by whispering to him the secrets that he wanted so badly, which drives him insane. While he undergoes a state of delirium, Enigma reveals to him the truth about the journals.",
      "Aeons after his escape into the Seven Planes, Enigma made his existence known to the inhabitants of the material plane by fabricating dozens of fake journals made by an alchemist named \"Jovat Kazran\" and hid them in secret places for alchemists to discover. The journal contained a log of Kazran's studies of the four fundamental forces of the universe and his successful attempts at his ascension to a Dark Fundamental as well as the items necessary to become one. However, Enigma has intentionally left out the last page, which is supposed to contain the final step of a spell that turns the caster into a Dark Fundamental.  The last page doesn't actually exist, but this will only fuel the curiosity of those who seek Enigma's powers and force them turn to him for the mysteries of the last page.",
      "He steals the World Chasm Artifact from Cedric and casually puts them on. However, he is no thief, so he holds up his end of the transaction by turning Cedric into an eidolon. With Cedric's dark ascension accomplished, he prepares his newfound recruit for the upcoming battle and puts his invention to the test."

      "The people of Ashkavor crowded around the temple square, eager to witness the ascension of their new guardian -- to stand near the man as he bound their souls to his own. But as his final brush strokes fell against the runestone, and the bond of a new Ascended One was forged, everyone -- even those who'd stayed in their homes -- could sense that something had gone terribly wrong.He knew the cause instantly. The droplets of ichor he'd procured to amplify the potency of his inkpots had instead contaminated them, and the power of the binding spell he'd cast now threatened to consume him. An inky corruption snaked upward from the runestone, along the handle of his brush, soon overtaking his hands. From there it spread quickly. Once it overcame his face and his mouth, he couldn't have screamed even if he'd wanted to.All of his life he'd calculated on how to attain ever greater powers than the limits presented by his teachers would allow--going so far as to break the sacred prohibition against augmenting the inks. Indeed, with the Wellspring of the Ascended Bond open to him, he felt a measure of power coursing into his soul like he'd never imagined. His greatest triumph was upon him, if he could only survive it.He drew deep from the power of the bond, pushing back against the corrupted ink flow. A great moan filled the air -- the collective cry of his people. Some swayed on their feet. The weakest collapsed. Many tried to run. And still deeper he pulled from their bloodline reservoir. But it wasn't enough to stop the ink tide.It was only when the breath trapped in his lungs began to fail him, and the inkpool darkness fully encased him, that he saw his way out. The bond he'd made with the Ashkavoran people -- his people -- meant to be drawn upon only in service of their protection... It flowed two ways.With a final surge of strength -- this time directed by more than just blind repulsion -- he pushed the ink torrent into the bond itself.Slowly, he felt the tide retreat... and heard the awful wails of his people as the corruption in turn rolled over them. When at last the ink relented, his eyes opened upon a world changed. The Ashkavoran people as he knew them were gone. Every last soul was transformed into terrifying shades of their former selves -- comprised no longer of blood and bone, only viscid, tainted ink."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Grimstroke is an Ashkavorian, the last of the Ascended Ones. Devious and haughty by nature, he is shadowed by the dark remnants of his former kin, twisted and transformed by his own lust for power. Trained from birth to be his people's protector, Grimstroke's personal ambitions instead led him to corrupt his own Ascension, creating a being shrouded  by malevolent ink. With grandiose designs in mind, he sets out with his great brush to redesign the world as he sees fit. Grimstroke is cunning and calculating in his plans, and he alone holds back the ink tide from consuming more than it already has.",
      "As a child, Grimstroke was destined to become a guardian of his people, a task for which he was prepared by his sagely teachers. Like others before him, he would one day be Ascended, binding his soul to all other Ashkavorians, thus forming a protective link. His mentors taught him the limits of this bond, and forbade any augmentation of the ritual, not realizing their pupil's dark ambitions until it was too late. Brought up in the rarefied environment of high arts and sophistication, Grimstroke took on an elitist attitude, showing much disdain for those of lower class.",
      "Grimstroke during his Ascension, covered by corrupted ink",
      "On the day of his Ascension, Grimstroke entered the temple at the center of Ashkavor, and dipped his brush in the sacred inkpots, which he had contaminated beforehand with drops of strange ichor. As he set his brush to the temple's runestone, the corrupted ink took hold of him. At first, he resisted the ink using the new bonds he had forged with his fellow Ashkavorians, but even their combined strength was insufficient. As the ink engulfed his body, he decided to channel its darkness into the bonds instead, instantly corrupting the other Ashkavorians, turning them into beings of shade.",
      "Having annihilated his own people, Grimstroke fled the temple.",
      "After the Ascension ritual, Grimstroke attempted to return to Ashkavor, but found himself driven away by the shadowy revenants that used to be his kin. Eventually, he gained mastery over his newfound powers, and made his way back to the temple grounds, where it had stood lifeless and unchanged since he'd left it. Upon his return, he took possession of an ancient brush, imbued with the magic of his ancestors' bloodlines. The revenants howled at his arrival, but he took control over them, using their collective bond to corrupt more victims.",
      "The remnants of the Ashkavorians maintain a level of autonomy, however. They seek death for themselves, or failing that, to drag Grimstroke into the afterlife with them.",
      "But not all Ashkavorians were corrupted by Grimstroke's hand, the Ascended Ones remain, and hope to restore their people once more. However, their powers were greatly warped by the ink tide, and they barely survive. Grimstroke endeavors to corrupt the Ascended Ones as well, bringing them under his control with the power of the Ancients, thereby completing his bond with all Ashkavorians. In search of more victims, the same binding rituals once meant to protect his people were twisted towards more nefarious uses.",
      "Grimstroke's reasoning for his actions is not fully known, but he contends that his people brought their fate upon themselves.",
      "Yaovhi, Grimstroke's lover, before her transformation",
      "Prior to his Ascension, Grimstroke fell in love with Yaovhi, an Ashkavorian woman whom he treasured deeply. She, too was consumed by the ink tide, and transformed into a dark phantom who now serves at his side, haunting and tearing at his foes. While Grimstroke feels no sorrow for the destruction of his people, he still remininsces about Yaovhi, but tries not to dwell on the unchangeable past.",
      "Trained in the ways of the brush from a young age, Grimstroke has grown to admire the arts, commenting on works literary and visual. He is open to collaboration with other creators, and takes the time to peruse their collections. In addition, he also has an interest in sculptures and antiquities. He looks down on dance, refusing to consider it a form of art.",
      "Grimstroke's love for secrets is personal, and is possibly one of the reasons he corrupted his Ascension ritual in the first place. He is never shy in asking other shady characters about the secrets they may be hoarding, or may have heard on the winds of rumor.",
      "One of Grimstroke's teachers falling to the ink tide. Xin and an unknown figure is seen in the background.",
      "True to his blackened persona, Grimstroke finds much to admire in similarly sinister figures like Rotund'jere, Shadow Demon or Balanar, whom he considers a \"beautiful creature\". Surprisingly, he cares little for the Dead God, and despises the Dead God's unending Dirge.",
      "Upon meeting Sylla, he states that he's met another druid before, although whom this refers to is unknown.",
      "Grimstroke has a particular hatred for the three spirit brothers: Xin, Kaolin, and Raijin, so much so that he finds their mere existence to be offensive. The reason for this hatred is not clear, but it appears the spirits were involved in some calamity of Ashkavor's past, possibly leading Grimstroke to pursue greater powers in the first place. He accuses Kaolin of being a puppet for some unknown master, Xin of stealing his flame from the Burning Celestial, and Raijin of wearing Thunderkeg like a \"skin suit\". "

But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device.As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight.As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload."

Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar's spirit had been saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice.In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further. As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing the power his total sacrifice could bring."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "When Huskar returned from the Nothl realm, he came back with secrets that none of his tribal elders recognized. He now uses these secrets to further his own interests.",
      "According to Huskar, dependence on mana is considered unholy, showing a preference for raw lifeforce instead. This is in line with his culture's custom of sacrificing people to the Nothl Realm.",
      "Like Dazzle, Huskar belongs to the Dezun Order, where he serves as a warrior.",
      "Jah'rakal despises Huskar, because he reminds him of himself.",
      "Huskar is a sacred warrior, transformed from his harrowing experience in the Nothl Realm. Huskar values vitality above all, and shares respect for heroes who do the same, such as  Bloodseeker and  Witch Doctor. He likens life to a holy chalice, spilled when a being dies.",
      "Huskar's people appears to be based on the indigenous peoples of the New World. Deeply spiritual, they shun technology in favor of implements made from sacrificial bones, and sharpened stone, such as obsidian.",
      "Coming from similar backgrounds, Huskar considers  Dazzle a cousin. Despite this, he resents him for bringing him back from the Nothl Realm."

     ],
     "Intro": [
      "In its earliest, and some would say most potent form, magic was primarily the art of memory. It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power.The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells\u2014four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one\u2014with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it.But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap\u2014a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms).Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Carl is a curious child who still has much to learn. Majority of his interactions with allied and enemy heroes involve him questioning their looks, powers, capabilities, intentions, etc.",
      "Carl is quite energetic and playful. This can be seen in his animations and his voice lines as well as his lines with other heroes. This also manifests in his burning taste for adventure.",
      "During his years in the academia, Carl used to be a shy person. He later came into his own (as said by his late headmaster) and became much more sociable.",
      "Carl has a childish innonence. He gets a bit disgusted upon killing someone and feels uncomfortable around people with revealing clothing.",
      "Carl is extremely narcisstic. He thinks very highly of himself but has little to no regard for anyone, sometimes he doesn't even acknowledge their existence or he simply forgets them at short notice. This is evident in his intentional lack of ally/rival responses, as confirmed by the developers themselves. Although he may not have any regard for anyone, he tends to divert the attention of others to himself, yet another common trait among narcissists. His personal taste in clothing also reflects this very well.",
      "Carl's powerful intellect makes him worthy of his extreme solipsism. He acknowledges that his mind is the only one to surely exist, and the rest of what he perceives are but mere extensions of his thoughts.\nSuch is his solipsism that it has also made him believe that he is the progenitor and embodiment of all creation.",
      "Such is his solipsism that it has also made him believe that he is the progenitor and embodiment of all creation.",
      "For Carl to master such power would require him to be extremely disciplined. The dragon spirits within  Juggernaut's cleaved mask praise his discipline.",
      "First, one must have a spell well remembered in the Arcanery of their mind. To remember a spell, one must memorize in rich detail the specific mental formula for the spell. The caster's memory can be aided with the use of abstract mnemonic devices, but physical devices like spellbooks and grimoires may be used if one is not as smart as Carl. It is likely that Carl's orbs are his mnemonic devices that allow him to recall a spell's formula.\nThe mental formula of a spell allows the user to unlock it for use. Not being able to remember it means that the user will never know or even wield the spell until they have managed to memorize the formula. Once unlocked, the spell will be ready for use until it is discarded.",
      "The mental formula of a spell allows the user to unlock it for use. Not being able to remember it means that the user will never know or even wield the spell until they have managed to memorize the formula. Once unlocked, the spell will be ready for use until it is discarded.",
      "The Arcanery is heavily implied to be the mental capacity of a caster that can store a limited amount of spells. When a caster has successfully mastered a spell, it is stored in the Arcanery for later use. The mental capacity of one's Arcanery is heavily dependent on their memory and intelligence. If a caster is smart and has good memory, they can allot multiple but limited amount of spells into their Arcanery. Otherwise, they will have a smaller mental capacity for spells to use.\nFor those with a full or limited Arcanery, no more spells can be allotted to their memory. One must make room for more spells by simply forgetting it from their memory, creating space for new spells to cast.",
      "For those with a full or limited Arcanery, no more spells can be allotted to their memory. One must make room for more spells by simply forgetting it from their memory, creating space for new spells to cast.",
      "Although not mentioned, it is heavily implied that spells are cast by the user's thoughts since it does not rely on equipment, but rather the mind of the magician.",
      "It's possible that this spell is similar to the Frozen Arts of the sorceress  Crystal Maiden who channels cold winds from Icewrack to work her magic. When meeting her, the young Carl will say that he can \"make an ice wall\" like her, further implying that the magic he uses to cast it might be the same one as Rylai's. That being said, Carl invoking ice and storm may refer to him summoning the cold winds of Icewrack, instead of him using elemental orbs.",
      "Invoker states that these elementals can destroy the enemy's will just as they can destroy their armor. What this means in practice is unknown.",
      "Carl the Invoker is the one of the few remaining magicians who still practices the ancient sorcery of Invoke, allowing him to harness not one, but all three elements of Quas, Wex, and Exort as well any magic he deigns to learn through sheer will, intelligence, and memory.",
      "Among the earliest practitioners of magic in its most potent and ancient form, there was a child prodigy named Carl. Such was his intellect and memory that he could master more than four spells\u2014the highest amount of spells that a devoted wizard could hope to master with the most of their brainpower. He was enrolled in the long-established Ultimyr Academy that honed his already impressive skills in magic. The young Carl excelled at every curricular task given to him and basked in the praise given for being so competent, but he dreamt of a future where he answered to no one but himself, where he could freely use his growing powers.",

He was enrolled in an ancient wizard's renowned academy for the mystic arts that honed his already impressive skills in magic. The young Carl excelled at every curricular task given to him and basked in the praise given for being so competent, but he dreamt of a future where he answered to no one but himself, where he could freely use his growing powers.",
      "The blurb for The Good Old Days voice pack says that the long years of his nigh-immortal life have taken an unimaginable toll on his personality. The detriments that happened in those years might've been the reason why he is drastically different from his younger self.",
      "In the early days after his escape from the academia, Carl sought to test his growing skills by any means attainable. He found a great opportunity for adventure and trials in the field of battle and answered the call to war, becoming a battle mage.",
      "There was once an age where fear and superstition surrounded sorcery and its practitioners. Tales were told of the Invoker, a powerful and oppressive wizard who would destroy those without the gifts of magic. Such was his ferocity that it had a powerful effect on the reputation of the magical arts during that time.",
      "Carl may have once joined the Burning Cabal faction, a group of invokers who specialize in fire manipulation and favor Exort over all other magical disciplines.",
      "In Dota: Dragon's Blood, the Invoker is one of the main protagonists of the series. A nameless Elven sage, the Invoker lives as a stoic but wise recluse in his tower which is filled to the brim with magic, causing it to be invisible to all but those with a gifted sight or magic items that grant supernatural vision.",
      "Tales among the \"moon children\" speak of a sage who is said to have the power to bring back the true goddess Mene who dwells in the magical lotuses in the pools of Selemene's Temple. A young but determined Elven youth named Fymryn is determined to meet this man and fulfill the prophecy, setting the series' events into motion towards a fate of cosmic proportions where Heaven and Hell clash beyond their boundaries, a fate that she never intended to achieve.",
      "To see the full involvement of the Invoker in this series, please check the page for Dota: Dragon's Blood episodes and their plot. At the end, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on Foulfell after his defeat.",
      "The young Carl claims to know  Warlock's great great...great ancestor. Given that Demnok and Carl have both been to Ultimyr Academy, he may actually be referring to Demnok's ancestor that he may have met in his ancient academy.",
      "Among Carl's many names throughout the aeons,  Rubick knew him in a time when he used to be called the \"Arsenal Magus\". ",
      "Puck has some knowledge of Carl, claiming to remember him from a distant past. This says much about Invoker's age.",
      "Undying and  Queen of Pain are some of the few who know him enough to call him by his true name of power, Carl.  Mirana is also one of the few who knows him by the name of Carl, but this might just be a pun on his name rather than something related to the lore.",
      "According to Dark Willow's gossip,  Axe and  Anti-Mage want to beat up Carl. The former can be seen in a card art for the spinoff game Artifact.",
      "While Carl is best known for his immense spell casting capabilities, he would never have that power in the first place if he lacked the sheer intellect to wield it. Carl is so intelligent that the effects of a hood that magically boosts one's intellect are wasted on him, for he already possesses high mental capacity beyond what the hood's power can bring. His mind was powerful enough to charge a tattered and faded set of solar themed clothing to life, revealing its true brilliant form when he put them on.",
      "Alongside the Grand Magus, Carl was able to see the mysteries that the  Templar Assassin vowed to protect. A rogue aspect of  Spectre says that he could almost \"see\".",
      "Carl is one of the few quasi-immortals who have mastered a potent and ancient form of magic lost to the ages. Although his magic doesn't seem to have an official name, the spells that he casts are known as Invocations. This should mean that  Invoke is his brand of magic, according to his younger self.",
      "Invoke is a unique spell casting system that heavily relies on the caster's memory to be effective. This is the full process of using Invoke, including the procurement of spells. Note that the following only applies to how Carl uses this magic, and not others who may use it as well.",
      "As unique as it is from other kinds of magic, it still requires mana as a resource for casting its spells. Aether (also known as void or nothingness) is an essential ingredient in the arts of the arcane, including Carl's magic.",
      "Alongside his Invoke magic, Carl has three elemental orbs that he uses alongside Invoke to cast spells, manipulate the elements, and use their metaphysical properties such as the \"strength\" of fire and the \"fortitude\" of ice.",
      "Quas allows for manipulation of ice elements. Besides the elements, it also grants him bonus regeneration, but it's not clear if it restores either health or mana only or both, since he has likened his Quas to a Regeneration Rune. Quas may act as a catalyst that boosts the properties of his spells that rely on Quas to be invoked. However, it hasn't been acknowledged in the lore yet.",
      "Wex allows for manipulation of storm elements. It also grants additional speed in both movement and combat. It's possible that Wex acts as a catalyst that increases the speed or movement properties of spells that require Wex. As of now, this is just gameplay mechanics, but given how some gameplay elements are acknowledged or translated into the lore, it might be a good possibility.",
      "Exort allows for manipulation of fire elements. It also increases the damage of the user, but the bonus is implied to cost something, at least according to his younger self. It may be said that Exort's damage boosting properties are catalysts that affect the power of spells that rely on Exort when invoked, but so far, this has not been acknowledged in Dota 2's lore yet.",
      "Runes are said to be forged of the most fundamental magic. If the young Carl claims that he can sense his orbs' powers in these runes, then his orbs may have something to do with the creation of runes. Furthermore, it may even be said that Quas, Wex, and Exort could be the fundamental magic that creates these runes.",
      "These spells are currently in Carl's mental Arcanery, where he can quickly access them from his mind and memory for him to cast.\n\n Cold Snap is invoked when using three instances of Quas. The spell is also known as \"Sadron's Protracted Frisson\". If Vancian magic rules were used, then \"Sadron\" should be the creator of this spell. No mere freezing magic, this cantrip does not directly freeze the opponent in ice like most spells, but rather saps the heat from their body and freezes them as a consequence instead.\n\n Ghost Walk is invoked when using two instances of Quas and one instance of Wex. It is also known as \"Myrault's Hinder-Gast\" or \"Geist of Lethargy\". A rule of Vancian magic would dictate that \"Myrault\" would be the creator of this spell. Based on its lore, the names of this spell, and its effects in gameplay, the cantrap renders Carl invisible by controlling the ice and electrical energies to create an elemental imbalance that slows both him and anyone within his proximity.\n\n Ice Wall is invoked when using two instances of Quas and one instance of Exort. It is also known as \"Killing Wall of Koryx\" or \"Bitter Rampart\". If the rules of Vancian sorcery are to be applied, then \"Koryx\" would be the spell's creator. This spell simply creates a wall of ice that emanates a bitter aura of debilitating cold. When casting this spell, Carl may call upon the White Waste, which is likely another name for the Frozen Wastes. His younger self states that he invokes ice (Quas) and storm (Wex) when he uses this magic, which contradicts the elemental combo meant for this spell.",
      "E.M.P. is invoked when using three instances of Wex. E.M.P. stands for Extractive Mana Pulse, but it still retains its original meaning: electromagnetic pulse. It is also known as either \"Endoleon's Malevolent Perturbation\" or \"Shimare's Extractive Pulse\". With the rules of Vancian magic, the creator would either have to be \"Endoleon\" or \"Shimare\". The spell will cause a charge of electromagnetic energy that depletes the mana of those caught in the blast.\n\n Tornado is invoked when using two instances of Wex and one instance of Quas. Also known as \"Claws of Tornarus\". A rule of Vancian magic would imply that \"Tornarus\" is the true creator of the spell. When cast, it unleashes a fast moving tornado that forcefully throws victims into the air to whirl and suspend helplessly for a few moments. The tornado's wind will then dissipate, allowing the affected to fall to their demise.\n\n Alacrity is invoked when using two instances of Wex and one instance of Exort. Alacrity is also known as \"Zeal of Wexort\" or \"Gaster's Mandate of Impetuous Strife\". This battle spell was made in the Age of Gaster to solve the predicament of mages being unable to properly face well-armed opponents in close quarters. Once it's cast, it infuses the target with an immense surge of energy that boosts their combat speed and increases their damage.\n\n Sun Strike is invoked when using three instances of Exort. It's also known as \"Harlek's Incantation of Incineration\". However, according to the Magus Apex, the spell comes from the Sol Apex Incantation. When cast, it focuses a powerful ray of solar energy from the sun to a targeted location, incinerating anything caught in its wake. Lorewise, Carl does not really see where this spell hits when he casts it too far from him, so he must rely on prediction to hit enemies that are out of his line of sight.",
      "Forge Spirit is invoked when using two instances of Exort and one instance of Quas. It is also known as \"Culween's Most Cunning Fabrications\". Rules of Vancian sorceries imply that \"Culween\" is the spell's creator. When cast, it summons a fiery elemental/s that embodies the strength of fire from Exort and the fortitude of ice from Quas. This flame elemental has a  Melting Strike that can melt through enemy armor. His younger self summons a dragon hatchling with the same powers.",
      "Chaos Meteor is invoked when using two instances of Exort and one instance of Wex. Chaos Meteor's other names are \"Voidal Pyroclasm\", \"Tarak's Descent of Fire\", and \"Gallaron's Abyssal Carnesphere\". Vancian magic rules dictate that either \"Tarak\" or \"Gallaron\" would be the maker of this spell. When cast, Carl will pull a meteor from space and send it unto the target location, causing the meteor to burn up into a flaming projectile. It will devastate the target area upon landing, before rolling forward to crush and incinerate anything in its wake until it crumbles. This spell, alongside his tall ornate pauldrons, are proof that Invoker's power can even reach the realm of outer space.",
      "These spells have already been cast by him once and then permanently removed from his memory by Carl to make room for more spells. Some of these spells still have an effect on him up to the present day.\n\nThe Sempiternal Cantrap is the source of Carl's immortality. This longevity spell is said to be so powerful that those who casted it in the world's earliest days can live long enough to the present age. This is quite vague, but we can at least estimate Carl's age by some of his voice lines: his younger self recognizes  Broodmother who has lived for many untold centuries and he knows the Mo'rokai before they were made dormant for centuries. Therefore, this spell is powerful enough to preserve Carl for many centuries. It is also stated that the user cannot die unless they have been crushed into atoms, but it is unknown if this means invulnerability, regeneration, or resurrection."

Io is nothing less than the sum of all attractive and repulsive forces within the material field, a sentient manifestation of the charge that bind existence together. It is only in the controlled warping of these electrical waylines that Io's presence can be experienced on the physical plane. A benevolent, cooperative force, Io bonds its strange magnetism to others so that the power of allies might be enhanced. Its motives inscrutable, its strength unimaginable, Io moves through the physical plane, the perfect expression of the mysteries of the universe."

After Earthshaker merged with a fragment of his sister earth, his concern about the malevolent entities that destroyed it caused him to seek out Io, and discuss ways of traveling through space so he can do battle with the entities."

     ],
     "Intro": [
      "Even among magical beasts, a twin-headed dragon is a freak. Equal parts ice and fire, cunning and rage, the creature known as Jakiro glides over charred and ice-bound battlefields, laying waste to any who would bear arms against it. Pyrexae dragon clutches always contain two fledglings. Famous for their viciousness even from the first moments of life, newly hatched dragons of this species will try to kill their sibling while still in the nest. Only the strongest survive. In this way is the strength of the Pyrexae line ensured. By some accident of nature, the freak Jakiro hatches from a single egg, combining in a single individual the full range of abilities found within the diverse Pyrexae species. Trapped within the armature of its monstrous body, the powers of ice and fire combine, and now no enemy is safe."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Jakiro's duality grants him the traits of both Pyrexae heritages. His icy head inherits their wisdom and guile, while his fiery head inherits their rage and ferocity.",
      "A trait natural to most fictional dragons, Jakiro is a very territorial creature.\nBecause of this, Jakiro is one of the more noble and protective dragons, something that is quite uncommon in fantasy works. He protects the cliffs of Grosche from invaders and once came to the aid of the people in Riverwarren, who still celebrate his deeds in his absence.",
      "Because of this, Jakiro is one of the more noble and protective dragons, something that is quite uncommon in fantasy works. He protects the cliffs of Grosche from invaders and once came to the aid of the people in Riverwarren, who still celebrate his deeds in his absence.",
      "As a polycephalic creature, Jakiro's heads treat each other as brothers, with neither of them being the elderly or superior one. They often find themselves unwilling to share and blame each other like siblings. On the positive side, they often compliment each others quips and achievements and care for each other, regarding themselves as equals.",
      "Jakiro, the Twin Headed Dragon, is a polycephalic Pyrexae dragon with the powers of ice and fire as their birthright. His very birth was an anomaly among the Pyrexae, because he was hatched from a single egg with two heads sharing a single body. Defying the very process that ensures the strength of the Pyrexae species, Jakiro is shunned as an anathema among his race and even hunted down by his own kin, with dragonslayers making his life much harder.",
      "But his race did not consider that Jakiro himself was a true testament to the Pyrexae's strengths. Although a single Pyrexae has a powerful affinity to a single element, Jakiro can wield the full range of every ability found in the diverse Pyrexae species with great synergy. With such power contained in a one in a million, no foe is safe as the elements combine in Jakiro to render his enemies into an unrecognizable mess of ice crystals and blackened flesh.",
      "Born from the flesh of a mother Eldwurm and an unknown father, the dragon freak Jakiro hatches from a single egg with two heads, one burning with the rage of the fiery Pyrexae lineage and another freezing with the guile of the icy Pyrexae lineage. Shunned and sometimes hunted by his race for being an anomaly among the wise but fearsome Pyrexae, Jakiro relies on his duality of powers and traits to destroy all manner of beings and creatures who dare to project any hostility towards him.",
      "Among the Mer folk, there are tales of a \"twin headed demon\" that killed a raiding party (save for two survivors) consisting of the finest Slithereen warriors in the waters surrounding the cliffs of Grosche. Their warnings speak of the demon that protected the bluffs of Grosche. When the party of raiders encroached upon the dragon's territory at night, Jakiro's fire head attacked the party, but they managed to find safety within their own element of the sea. However, his frost head froze the invaders atop the waves that should have protected them. The two remaining survivors could only watch as Jakiro's fiery head incinerated the oblivious raiders.",
      "Jakiro once descended into the underground caverns of the Riverwarren to protect its inhabitants during a time of great need. Since that day, his appearance and deeds are always commemorated in the Day of the Pyres where stories and celebrations of their protector are told and held, respectively. As the children grow up, their dreams of the dragon's return fade with time, but one day Jakiro will return to help the people of the caverns once more.",
      "According to Jakiro,  Winter Wyvern is his cousin. However, Auroth seems to have an animosity towards him, and expresses regret that she didn't kill them before they have hatched. Valve writer Steve Jaros confirmed that Auroth is indeed his mother.",
      "As said in his bio, the Pyrexae are magical beasts. A statement from Wei expands on this feature, where she says that Jakiro is brimming with magic.",
      "An interesting detail can be found in Jakiro's right head. The scales on his lower neck resemble that of his mother's, Auroth the Winter Wyvern. It can be speculated that his right head inherited some of Auroth's ice powers alongside the powers of the icy Pyrexae heritage.",
      "Possessing the full range of abilities found in the Pyrexae dragon species, Jakiro commands the elements of ice and fire just by breathing. His twin headed nature and elemental duality grants him the ability to synergize his naturally incompatible elements to deadly effect.",
      "Dual Breath is a great example of his elemental synergy. Jakiro's frost head initiates the attack with a blast of ice, followed by a wave of fire launched by his fiery head. It would seem that neither elements cancel each other out, allowing its victims to take the full effect of being frozen and burnt at the same time.",
      "Ice Path is a very simple ability. Jakiro's frost head calls upon the cold element of his Pyrexae lineage to create a trail of ice that freezes anyone caught in its wake.",
      "Yet another simple and straightforward ability, his  Liquid Fire comes from the fiery head of Jakiro, allowing him to expel a scorching molten substance. It can be speculated that this hot material is the same molten steel found in the guts of Pyrexae who consume even the armor and equipment of slain knights.",
      "His  Liquid Frost lacks any kind of lore text, but it can be assumed that it works similarly to its fiery counterpart, except for the use of molten steel. Liquid Frost could simply be a cold substance that chills and freezes opponents covered in it.",
      "Although his  Macropyre only shows his flames being used, the lore text for this ability describes that Jakiro combines its frost and flame to decimate the battlefield with extreme temperatures on both high and low ends. This can be seen in the custom  Macropyre effect of his Pyrexaec Forge cosmetic where the cracks on the earth glow blue (presumably his ice powers) while his fire burns on top of it, neither elements being able to cancel each other out."

      "No one has ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Yurnero the Juggernaut. It is only speculation that he even has one. For defying a corrupt lord, Yurnero was exiled from the ancient Isle of Masks--a punishment that saved his life. The isle soon after vanished beneath the waves in a night of vengeful magic. He alone remains to carry on the Isle's long Juggernaut tradition, one of ritual and swordplay. The last practitioner of the art, Yurnero's confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his expression. For a hero who has lost everything twice over, he fights as if victory is a foregone conclusion."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "It is said that Yurnero doesn't feel sad for what he has lost, for he is implacable and purges that grief with a pursuit for honor. However, he sometimes broods over something that he has lost, which might be his beloved Isle or his lost relationship with Lanaya.",
      "When engaged in battle, Yurnero lets all of his fury out on his foes. Despite this, he stands between black and white to become grey\u2013being emotionally distant and not even revealing his other emotions and thoughts to anyone, reserving nothing to others but his sword and hand.",
      "Even after the destruction of his Isle, Yurnero still adheres to the Isle's culture that revolves around honor and respect. He respects worthy opponents who die by his hand (sometimes preserving their remains as his memento of the honor that they have) and lets them know that their deaths are honorable. He has no respect for cowards, and anyone who engages in acts of cowardice.",
      "Yurnero is a brave and courageous warrior, a result of his faith in the endless practice and refinement of his craft. It's one thing to face dangers and adversity without fear, but he knows that there is a clear boundary between being brave and being foolish. He was brave enough to defy the last lord of the Isles whom he believed was corrupt, and he defended the dishonorable outcasts of his island home, in spite of the knowledge that defending these people in the face of defying the authorities will grant him a fate far worse than what these outcasts have. He doesn't fear death, but he certainly prefers to steer clear from it. Sometimes, he relies on alcohol to get a boost of courage.",
      "Yurnero is a confident swordsman, the result of his faith in the endless practice and refinement of his arts. Perhaps it can be said that his conviction in his ability is what makes his bravery different from foolishness. This is reflected in his use of weapons that are deadly to the wielder and its target.",
      "Yurnero often celebrates battles with a banner that he carries on his back. He believes that a battle is no good if there's nothing to celebrate it.",
      "A stern and serious warrior, Yurnero practices and values discipline.",
      "An \u014ddachi forged in the fires that boiled the waters surrounding the Isle of Masks, causing it to rise and submerge the entire island.",
      "A dark sword that contains the soul of an unnamed entity. The fine script engraved on the sword tells the fated story of this trapped soul.",
      "A sword with large teeth that can hook and lock another weapon between its serrations.",
      "A sword with a blade made of jade, crafted by the Kuur-Ishiminari clan. It is quite unwieldy and hard to maintain because of its jade, but it is just as sharp as any good blade and is a symbol of noble prestige.",
      "The Serrakura, a sword that is as beautiful as it is deadly. Said to be crafted by a masked swordsman, but it is unknown if this refers to Yurnero or another Masked One before they were wiped out.",
      "An elegant sword that was forged by the master bladesmith Sabasteen thousands of years ago. Each deadly stroke from this sword is done elegantly.",
      "A sword that curses anyone who wields this sword in anger and those who face this sword with cruelty. The effects of the curse is unknown.",

While not explicitly stated, it may have belonged to the defunct Lost Order, who learned the ability to pierce the fabric of reality using their blades and formed a new school of Mastery revolving around this dangerous metaphysical technique.\nGiven that the Abyssal Blade once belonged to the Underlord, who also has the ability to warp reality with the arts of the Dark Rift, it is possible that this Mastery and the Dark Rift sorcery are related.\nIt's unknown how did Yurnero managed to recover the sword despite the elders' attempts to destroy all traces of their school's existence.",

      "These wards may come in the form of a gargoyle statue crafted by the Kuur-Ishiminari clan, a figure of an irresistable, furry peddler, a Pisces-like statue, etc.",
      "Yurnero the Juggernaut, named after the martial tradition that he swore to preserve and protect, is the last of his masked kind who drowned beneath the waves that deluged the ancient Isle of Masks. While his inanimate mask bears no readable expressions, each motion of his blade arm is an expression of a lost art that yearns to be remembered, and every ritual that he casts alone is but a shadow of the Isle's once lively and rich traditions.",
      "Yurnero had to earn his skill to become the master swordsman that he is today. He once trained under the tutelage of his late swordmaster (of whom we don't know the name of) until he became a swordmaster just like him. His master rewarded him with a traditional hakama and the sword Akakiryu which got its name from a legendary dragon.",
      "Long ago, Yurnero took it to himself to retrieve the Defender, a greatsword that stolen from the Ivory Isles. He slew its thieves and now wields the Defender with honor.",
      "Yurnero is a successful hunter with many kills under his belt, including demons and abominations, with a few of them possessing an alien hunting intellect. He was noted to have slain a brave beast with large tusks in a fierce battle and killed a mountain wolf with open handed strikes. He may have slain a single member of the now extinct corodont species, carving a mask out of its ivory heart.",
      "Although the original account tells us that Yurnero was exiled and banished to sea for his defiance against a high lord, there is another account of Yurnero's banishment. Upon his exile, he was fitted with a mask that symbolized his status as a Ronin with no master to guide him, which differed in appearance from his default mask that we are all familiar with.",
      "It's implied that Yurnero's exile happened for another reason besides his defiance against a corrupt lord. The context behind his insubordination was that he may have been complicit in defending the dishonored unmasked outcasts of the Isle of Masks. These wretched folk got their punishment from violating a creed or another. Their retribution was to be stripped of their honor and masks, and cast away from the reaches of society so that they may never again influence the affairs of the Isle. Defending these people even in the face of highborn defiance will elicit exile away from the Isle itself, the very same fate that Yurnero was inflicted with.",
      "Juggernaut's mask after being cracked by the Adjudicator's Blade.",
      "In an unspecified event, possibly a duel, Sven cleaved Yurnero's mask in two with the Adjudicator's Blade, cracking its top and awakening the ancestral souls that laid dormant inside it. Among the spirits was an ancient dragon, who now accompanies Yurnero and contributes his powers to him. Thus, the Juggernaut became a being merged from many souls. The dragon's might, combined with the great strength of his ancestors, made him more powerful than ever before. Yurnero and his dragon are grateful for Sven's actions, and feel they owe Sven a debt of gratitude.",
      "After the sundering, the Juggernaut and his dragon planned to restore what they have lost. Once the Ancient is destroyed, they vowed to bring back their people and begin the rebirth of the Isle of Masks.",
      "Yurnero is the latest and last issue of an ancient lineage of revered warriors who are the progenitors of the Isle of Masks. Most of these lost souls were masked people like him, but he also had a dragon spirit among his ancestors as well.",
      "Long ago, Yurnero used to train frequently with the  Ember Spirit. Their training sessions together always produced interesting results. He has great respect for Xin, even if they are pitted against each other.",
      "Phantom Lancer is an old friend of Yurnero's. As a pair of Radiant Heroes aligned against the Dire factions, they both know Kanna, and Yurnero may ask Azwraith about rumors regarding Kanna's return.",
      "Yurnero once had a romantic relationship with the  Templar Assassin, but the two broke up after he did something to upset her. Although he appears to have moved on already, he will still mourn her, even after he has lost control over his body when the many spirits in his mask took over and possessed him, who will also share his grief despite them not being familiar with her at all. Lanaya still feels jilted and hasn't gotten over the breakup. She is quite angry at Yurnero, to the extent of threatening violence, and attempting to make him jealous.",
      "The death of Yurnero by  Mars' hand signifies the completion of his uncle's collection. It's unknown who among his uncles, Hades or Poseidon, are collecting the likes of Yurnero, not to mention that the context of this situation is unknown.",
      "Yurnero is concerned about Sorla Khan's violent campaign. He wishes to discuss a solution to the problem with  Axe.",
      "Yurnero owns a wide variety of swords, but it's possible that he acquired his many swords in separate continuities rather than accumulating a large arsenal. If one looks for a similarity within all of his weapons, one can notice that he always prefers to use two handed swords such as a katana or anything similar over any kind of weapon.",
      "Although he usually wields one sword at a time during battle, he is also prepared with a backup blade, just in case his primary weapon isn't enough.",
      "Within Yurnero is the last remnants of the Isle's many martial traditions. He is the sole practitioner of the long standing Juggernaut tradition, a lost art that consists of bladework and voodoo magic rituals. When gripping a sword in battle, he always makes sure that each refined strike that he lands takes his passion, intentionality, and respect into consideration. He is skilled and confident enough to safely wield a blade with no guard, which is dangerous because the guard prevents the hand from slipping towards the blade when thrusting as well protecting the hand from any incoming blade that slides down to the wielder's hands.",
      "He is well known for his skills with the sword during battle, but he is still quite dangerous when unarmed, being able to kill a mountain wolf with only open-handed strikes.",
      "All of Yurnero's abilities are applications of the Juggernaut tradition.",
      "Blade Fury is a simple technique where the user spins their sword around them to slash at nearby enemies. In this state, the user will repel incoming magic, leaving them unharmed and unaffected. Yurnero's use of this technique has made it renowned and feared by warriors and sorcerers alike. It can easily cut through the Broodmother's strongest webs and it is complimented by  Battle Fury, although this might just be a reference to gameplay.",
      "A portable  Healing Ward can be summoned by a ritual. The ward heals others' wounds with its voodoo magic. Even after the drowning of the Isle of Masks, the healing arts haven't lost any of its potency.",

      "Ezalor, the Keeper of the Light"
     ],
     "Intro": [
      "Upon a pale horse he rides, this spark of endless suns, this Keeper of the Light. Ezalor long ago escaped the Fundamental Plane, separating from the other ancient forces to which he was bound within the great Primordial harmony. He is a power grown sentient in the dawn of the universe, and now rides forth in all planes at once, one step ahead of pursuing chaos, bearing his gift with him at the end of a radiant staff. His majestic truth lies hidden beneath the outward appearance of a slightly doddering old man who barely stays in the saddle. However, when faced with the challenge of chaos, or the forces of darkness, his primordial light bursts forth, and his full power is revealed, transforming him once again into a force to be reckoned with."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Ezalor is prone to forgetfulness, but this behavior affects him deeper than what we observe from his physical guise. He is not forgetful because he takes on the form of an old man, but because it's actually an outward expression of the force that he embodies: the weak nuclear force, which is best known for mediating the process of radioactive decay.\nDecay may be associated with forgetfulness in the elderly, because their capacity for making and retrieving memories often deteriorates (or decays) with age.\nHence, Ezalor did not choose to take on the form of an old man, but his guise is a result of him creating a form that bests represents what he truly embodies.\nExplanations aside, his forgetfulness often gets him into trouble with his kin and even himself.",
      "Decay may be associated with forgetfulness in the elderly, because their capacity for making and retrieving memories often deteriorates (or decays) with age.",
      "Hence, Ezalor did not choose to take on the form of an old man, but his guise is a result of him creating a form that bests represents what he truly embodies.",
      "Explanations aside, his forgetfulness often gets him into trouble with his kin and even himself.",
      "Ezalor is a benevolent and noble being. Even after abandoning his mantle, he still does his best to beat back evil whenever it is found while still helping those who need his gift of light, no matter what form he takes. His voicelines and the way he speaks them has an air of heroism and nobility.",
      "Among other heroes, he has a reputation of being a funny old man to them.",
      "Some of Ezalor's voicelines when he meets with allied female heroes show that he is quite flirtatious with females, regardless of their race or species. It's unknown if this is just a gag on him being a perverted old man or an actual aspect of his personality, as none of the women that he directs these lines to acknowledge this and he doesn't even display this behavior in Dota Underlords.",
      "As for why this ability represents the weak force, it has a similar mechanism to radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is the process of an unstable atomic nucleus losing energy by radiation. Radiation is the emission, transmission, or propagation of energy in the form of waves through space or matter. Think of radiation as a movement process.",
      "Comparing Mana Leak/Solar Bind to radioactive decay, both of them cause something to lose a resource just by moving. If an enemy is under the effect of these spells, they will lose mana or movement speed and magic resistance whenever they move.",
      "According to Aghanim,  Dazzle's powers over light and dark are a mix of chakra magic and chaos magic, respectively. It's possible that Dazzle's light powers share the same source with Ezalor's, who also uses chakra magic.\nIf that is the case, then Ezalor may be related to or have something to do with the Nothl Realm.",
      "If that is the case, then Ezalor may be related to or have something to do with the Nothl Realm.",
      "These abilities are almost similar to each other in gameplay. Lorewise, Io's ability uses its omnipresence over space and the Seven Planes as well as its ability to teleport to use Relocate, allowing Io to relocate anyone to any point in space while still being with them at their destination, since it is omnipresent.",
      "Like Io, Ezalor is omnipresent as he is a Fundamental, who exists across all planes at once. Since they share this trait and possess similar teleportation or planeshifting skills, it may be assumed that Recall is simply Ezalor's version of Relocate that may or may not have any differences.",
      "Upon a pale horse he rides, this spark of ancient suns. Ezalor, the Keeper of the Light, rides forth from the shattered Primordial harmony to bring the gift of life and light throughout the many corners of the vast universe, while remaining one step ahead from the ancient forces of chaos and darkness.",
      "A force of the universe that has grown sentient in the dawn of time, he embodies and identifies himself as the weak nuclear force, a fundamental force that is unique among the others with its transmutative capabilities on the subatomic level (compared to the other forces which are attractive and repulsive) as well as the ability to manipulate magic and its very essence.",
      "Before time even began to flow, the fundamental laws of the universe were all bound together by the great Primordial harmony in the far and upstream Fundamental Plane made by the One we know as Elder Titan. At the dawn of the universe, these inanimate forces gained the gift of sentience and expression through unexplained means. With the capacity to feel and think, the spark of ancient suns came to be known as Ezalor, the Keeper of the Light, and the four Fundamentals were born. Soon after, the Primordial harmony was broken (either by Ezalor with his ability to disrupt harmony or Elder Titan who caused the Schism) and the sentient Fundamentals were set loose into the many planes of the fragmented world left behind by their creator.",
      "Ezalor frequently mentions that he is on a quest, but the goal of this quest and why he partakes in it is currently unknown. He also claims to originate from a place known as Light's Keep, where he also returns to when he dies before riding out once more.",
      "Ezalor created and took on the mantle of the one who brought light to every corner of the universe and keeping darkness and chaos at bay with his powers over light and order, but abandoned this role soon after (likely due to the Chaos Knight doggedly chasing after him) leaving it to be taken up by anyone who wishes to continue his work.",
      "But it was under this mantle that Ezalor was in his prime, and he was in his prime when he was still the spark of ancient suns. Wielding a radiant staff, he channeled his powers to create the very first sun in the universe, a sentient and conscious beacon of light that can reproduce through supernova, resulting in an endless cycle of birth and rebirth. The first sun was the primogenitor of every sun and star in the universe, including the likes of Phoenix and Dawnbreaker",
      "Although he could give life to conscious stars, he can create lifeforms as well. In the earliest days following his exodus from the Fundamental Plane, Ezalor channeled his power to create a winged horse that inherited his gift, allowing it to aid his work in sparking suns to life.",
      "His work soon came to an end when the Chaos Knight set his sights upon him and chased after his fugitive brother who was said to have defied the first covenant when he escaped the Fundamental Plane. Ezalor was forced to abandon his work in response to the pressing danger at hand and left the mantle with no one around to give it to, until it was taken up by his grandchildren aeons later.",
      "Aeons later, Ezalor assumed a cunning disguise in the form of a doddering old man, a true outward embodiment of the fundamental force that is his identity. He has been observed appearing in different guises: a fortune teller, a wizard, and even a sage, but there are none so well documented as his guise of the Keeper of the Northlight.",
      "Legends from the remote frigid villages of the Wailing Mountains speak of a hooded old man who travels in the cold Northern wastes, appearing only to those who have lost their way and when evil or darkness makes its presence known in those lands. Upon a grey stag he rides, bearing the light of the famous North Star that has helped countless travelers to find their way, while banishing evil and darkness when he finds them.",
      "Ezalor is one of the few heroes in Dota 2 that has children of his own. All the stars and suns in the universe are his children, including  Phoenix,  Dawnbreaker, and her creators, the Children of Light, who are all descendants of the Keeper's first sun. Dawnbreaker is humbled by the presence of her great grandfather but she is also saddened that he did not do anything to save the Children of Light nor did he know about the fates that they chose. She is even furious at him for abandoning his descendants.",
      "The Solar Goddess, a divine figure whom  Lina worships, is a dilution of a greater lineage of star progeny (as in the stars and suns themselves) which includes the Dawnbreaker and her creators, the Children of Light. This would imply that the Solar Goddess is also a very distant descendant of Ezalor and his first sun.",
      "Since  Mars is the lover of Dawnbreaker, Ezalor would be his great grandfather-in-law. Mars seems to be deeply concerned about how he treated the Children of Light and why he abandoned them.",
      "Ezalor is the younger brother and antithesis to the  Chaos Knight, who has been hunting him down ever since the exodus of the Fundamentals from their progenitor realm. The Chaos Knight claims that he seeks to destroy all order and creation as well snuff out the Light from every plane of existence but he belies an ulterior motive where he truly seeks to reunite his siblings back into the Fundamental Plane.",
      "Like all Fundamentals, they are the children of the Elder Titan. That includes the two omnipresent forces  Io and  Enigma.",
      "Besides the Chaos Knight, Ezalor has been in some in-fighting with the children of the Schism. Enigma is hostile towards Ezalor, as he embodies the very force that causes a star to collapse on itself and die, turning it into a black hole. In Dota Underlords, Enigma also plans to replace him with  Tiny, for reasons unknown.",
      "Ezalor is a Fundamental, a fundamental law of the universe that has gained sentient expression at the dawn of the universe's creation. It is currently unknown how Ezalor and his Fundamental brothers managed to become sentient beings, and it's even more mysterious if they got their sentience by themselves or someone/something else. He originates from a higher plane of existence known as the Fundamental Plane where they were once united as one force in/by the great Primordial harmony, which was either disrupted by Ezalor or shattered by his creator, allowing him to separate from the other ancient forces that he was once bound with.",
      "Like all Fundamentals and their creator, Ezalor is an omnipresent force that exists in all planes at once, allowing him to call upon other versions or aspects of himself to assist each other. Like his brother Chaos Knight who uses it to summon phantasms from other worlds, or Enigma who uses it to summon aspects of himself from other dimensions, Ezalor can utilize this omnipresence to summon a separate spirit to channel his abilities for him.",
      "Ezalor embodies the weak nuclear force, in contrast to his brother who embodies the strong nuclear force. The weak force is best known for being responsible for several kinds of radioactive decay, one of which is responsible for the process between subatomic particles that causes stars and suns to burn. With this power, Ezalor has sparked the heat of countless stars, lighting up every corner of the universe and gifting the sun's radiance to the distant worlds that find comfort from its rays, while allowing them to go and multiply via supernova to further extend the cycle of life. He also used his force to make sentient lifeforms, such as winged horses that inherit his powers, which means that the weak force can be used to create life as well.",
      "Hidden underneath the guise of an old man on a pale horse, Ezalor's true light manifests from his radiant staff or until he reveals it from beneath his outward appearance.",
      "Illuminate is a rather straightforward ability. Ezalor simply channels a burst of light from his radiant staff and releases it at the right moment to unleash a large wave of light. The internal glow of his staff is said to fill the souls of the innocent with tranquility while relieving them of their pain (likely flowery language that explains Illuminate's healing ability) but the wicked cannot bear the weight of this light.",
      "Ezalor's  Mana Leak is a good example of the weak nuclear force being integrated into his gameplay and his lore. By disrupting the so-called \"Primordial harmony\", Ezalor can cause those with poor constitution to uncontrollably drain their own magical energy. It is unknown if  Solar Bind operates under the same lore of the ability that it has replaced (besides being similar in terms of gameplay) since the spell was released without a lore description.",
      "Chakra Magic is one of Ezalor's most vague abilities. Lorewise, the skill is said to be Ezalor bestowing his \"harmony\" (likely referring to the Primordial harmony that's frequently mentioned in Ezalor's lore) upon others to restore their magical energy. Ezalor mentions chakra, kundalini, and the serpent of illumination when using this ability, but it's not yet known how these concepts relate to his powers.",
      "Just like his first spell,  Blinding Light is also a straightforward ability. It is simply a short blast of intense light that may threaten to blind those who look directly towards it.",
      "Will-O-Wisp is an interesting ability, as not only does Ezalor call upon the wisp Ignus Fatuus to aid him, but its lore description states that Ezalor has an uncanny influence over many powerful creatures that are always willing to help him even if he doesn't seem to be familiar with them. Basically, Ezalor can call upon creatures such as wisps to aid him and they will always answer his call, even if he forgets who they are. As for the capabilities of this wisp in the lore, it is currently unknown if we do not take gameplay mechanics into the question.",
      "Recall is yet another one of Ezalor's vague abilities, due to its obscure description. It can be speculated that this ability works similarly to Io's  Relocate (lorewise) for the two following reasons:",
      "Lastly,  Spirit Form is what happens when Ezalor sheds his mortal guise, allowing him to reveal the power that he truly embodies."

     "Intro": [
      "As The Admiral of the mighty Claddish Navy, Kunkka was charged with protecting the isles of his homeland when the demons of the Cataract made a concerted grab at the lands of men. After years of small sorties, and increasingly bold and devastating attacks, the demon fleet flung all its carnivorous ships at the Trembling Isle. Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide.As Kunkka watched the demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle's peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelrawn the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos.What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now The Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction. Whether he died in that crash is anyone's guess. Not even Tidehunter, who summoned Maelrawn, knows for sure."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "There is some speculation whether or not Kunkka is still alive, or has become a phantom after the battle at Trembling Isle. Since Kunkka is sometimes believed to be a phantom, it is possible that the Suicide-Mages' ritual caused him and his ship to survive in their ethereal forms after their destruction on the seas.",
      "Kunkka has had scurvy many times.",
      "Kunkka supposedly knows of \"terrible secrets\" at the bottom of the sea that only he can unlock by key.",
      "Kunkka is sometimes called \"Green Sleeves\" by his crew.",
      "Kunkka once received a fine sash as a gift from a princess, living in the Isle of Songs. The nature of this relationship is unclear.",
      "His notorious rivalry with  Tidehunter stems from the latter's involvement at the Trembling Isle, where Maelrawn was summoned to destroy the two opposing fleets. Despite formal animosity, Kunkka also holds a degree of respect for his nemesis, sometimes lamenting his death.",
      "Kunkka is enraged by Mireska, whom he blames for the loss of his fleet at the Trembling Isle. Mireska was stowed away on his ship in search of \"trophies\", and had some kind of involvement in the battle. Due to her actions, she is now hunted by Kunkka.",
      "Kunkka is the former admiral of the Claddish Navy. He comes from a line of seamen, who once hunted whales with harpoons. A veteran commander, he was present in the battle of Port Mignin, as well as the first and second battle of Trembling Isle. He wields the legendary Tidebringer, a sword inhabited by a lost Claddish soul.",
      "After the second battle Trembling Isle, Kunkka washed up on a Keenish shore, where he resumed his career as a fleet commander, with Keen as crew. Rumor is, he compelled Keen artisans to craft him a new sword from the salvage of Cataract Demons, who had also washed up on the same shore. The Keen apparently hold him in high regard, giving him the keys to the gates of their capital. At least one ship under his new command is known by name, the Majestic Leviathan, a great vessel carrying countless chests of treasure.",
      "Another unconfirmed rumor is that Kunkka parted the seas with his Neptunian Sabre, found Maelrawn, and sliced off one of the god's tentacles.",
      "While Kunkka does not appear to be a pirate, he does have a habit of looting precious objects when the opportunity presents itself. His Admiral persona is merely a disguise, his true identity is the dreaded Brownbeard the Brave one of the most feared pirates in the sea.",
      "As a young man, Kunkka served as a midshipman. He was ambitious, seeking to climb up the ranks. During his early days, he heard tales of great sharks, longer than a frigate, that hunted ships and devoured sailors. As he grew older and rose in rank, he earned the gold-laced buttons that indicated his new status. As an adult, he hunted and killed the giant sharks he heard about as a young man, confirming that such legends were true."

      "They came without warning. Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound, and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count, wielding flame and foul sorcery, slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose. Of once-mighty Stonehall's military strength only the Bronze Legion, led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin, was near enough to answer the call of battle. They rode into their city, fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets, cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion: an ethereal rift within the city square, and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion.Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer, the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade, cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil. Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast. It turned, smiling at her through a maze of teeth. Heedless of the battle raging around them, they charged one another.Deflecting blow after blow, the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them. Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her. The odds turned. The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly, a brutal thrust from the side, but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke. Blade scraped on blade, beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below, carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood. The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack, driving her blade through her foe's flesh into the stampeding heart within. With a scream that split the clouds above, the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish. The stygian portal wavered, the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel.Though victorious, the survivors saw little to celebrate: the city lay in ruins, and survivors were few. Fires continued to spread. Unfurling her banners of war, Tresdin gathered what allies she could. Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss, and damned be any who would dare stand in her way."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Tresdin battled the Abyssal Horde at Stonehall, led by Vrogros.",

      "Leshrac, the Tormented Soul"
     ],
     "Intro": [
      "Leshrac, Tormented Soul, is an entity torn from the heart of nature, a liminal being that exists half in one plane of existence, half in another. His penetrating intelligence is such that he can never ignore for a moment the agonizing horror at the heart of all creation. Once a great philosopher who sought the meaning of existence, he plumbed the depths of nature with the haunted Chronoptic Crystals, and was forever altered by the hideous mysteries thereby revealed to him. Now the darkest depths of his enlightenment are illumined only by the fitful glare of his arrogance. Like other elemental characters, he is completely at one with nature, but in his case it is a nature lurid and vile. He alone sees the evil truth of reality, and has no use for those who believe the cosmos reserves a special reward for those who practice benevolence."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Knowing that the truth of all nature is torment, suffering and decay, Leshrac's inherent actions reflect this dark philosophy. To cause the most torment and suffering as possible he shares his torments with others through his Chronoptic energies so that everyone can learn the true torment that they were once oblivious to. As for bringing about the most decay as possible, he does this by blasting and blighting nature. His cruelty and sadism stems from this belief, especially for torment and suffering.",
      "Leshrac is a nihilist. His brand of nihilism is unspecified, but he rejects the belief that Nature reserves a reward for the benevolent and has no use for those who believe that. He may have attained this nihilism from the fact that doing good means nothing when he has seen what the evil truth of reality really has in store for them. He desires an \"end to it all\", which he believes will allow him to learn the worse mysteries hidden by the Impurities.",
      "His brand of wisdom is also said to be bleak, which may be further proof of his nihilism. This also makes him a pessimist philosopher.",
      "Leshrac seems to be proud of his four legged body, reviling beings who only have two legs. In addition to that, he reviles beings with physical abnormalities. He sees the form of the Enchantress as a disgrace to four legs for some reason.",
      "He is so twisted from his former normal self that he feels alien in the natural world. He relates this with Puck, who is also alien to nature.",
      "This self-knowledge of him being the only entity who sees the truth of reality has made him arrogant, if he was not like that before his transformation. He even humiliates others upon killing them but realizes his humility upon dying. His tendency to humiliate others might be a part of his sadism.",
      "Leshrac is generally an unhappy creature. His twisted mind is often in a state of brooding, sometimes producing agonizing insights that painfully manifests on his physical form.  Compared to most Heroes who cheerfully and confidently declare \"It's in the bag\", he says it with no enthusiasm, as if he was forced to say it. He also hates fun.",
      "According to a rogue aspect of the Spectre, Leshrac has an ire that they consider insignificant. Perhaps this anger comes from his own state of torment or he is angry because he often attacks others angrily, such as reviling and impugning them. Not to mention that most of his voice lines have a raised voice.",
      "Leshrac states that he breaks the \"bones of earth\" when he uses this ability. With the aforementioned meaning of \"bones\" in that voice line, it is possible that this spell breaks deep into the earth layers that compose the structure or the skeleton of the planet itself, compromising the very structure of the earth and damaging it greatly.",
      "This ability is said to be an act of revenge from the earth itself, for reasons unknown.",
      "When he is equipped with a staff capped with a shard of haunted Chronoptic Crystal, he can call upon more of these crystals from the ground below, breaking the earth in the process. Just like what they did to Leshrac, the crystal's powers can bring eternal torment to others.",
      "The sounds made by its bursts of Chronoptic energies share the same sounds with Pulse Nova's energy waves, suggesting that both abilities utilize Chronoptic energy to work their power. This is evident in the yellow-orange and pink-purple color of the Edict's energy, a set of colors that can be found in other depictions of Chronoptic energy.",
      "His transformed and weaponized tail pulses desolation, which might be referring to this ability.",
      "The sounds produced by its waves of energy share the same sounds with the energy blasts of his Edict, suggesting that both abilities use Chronoptic energies to work their powers.  This is evident in the orange and pink color of Pulse Nova's energy, colors that can also be seen in the Chronoptic energy of Split Earth (see picture above) and Diabolic Edict.\nSupporting this is an unused voiceline for his Pulse Nova which describes it as an \"impure impulse\" which implies that its energy is impure.",
      "Supporting this is an unused voiceline for his Pulse Nova which describes it as an \"impure impulse\" which implies that its energy is impure.",
      "Leshrac, the Tormented Soul, is the elemental guardian of the evil truth of all creation beyond our benighted comprehension. With the elements of nature and the Chronoptic energies of nature's blasted core at his beck and call, the pristine natural world will soon mirror its horrifying counterpart as he ushers it to chaos, decay, and suffering.",
      "Leshrac often speaks of a state of utter chaos, which he seeks to achieve by tipping the balance of our world. In order to topple the balance of this world, he must bring the most indiscriminate desolation to this world and its inhabitants. He achieves this by blighting nature itself, twisting it into a blasted world (just like its blasted core) and utilizing whatever resource he has for the purpose of achieving imbalance. Those who are unfortunate enough to be sentient and animate are destroyed alongside the world that they dwell in, plus they are treated with a trip to the heart of all existence to see the unpleasant truth of nature, alongside other twisted intentions that Leshrac has in store. He also states that he must restore this state of imbalance, implying that it has already existed before and he is merely bringing it back.",
      "There are several reasons that motivate him to do all of these awful stuff. First of all, this Tormented Soul feels compelled to share his torment to others. Not only by inflicting suffering to those who cross his path, but by unlocking the innate torment that everyone has within them by enlightening them with the horrible truth of nature\u2014the very same way he realized that his whole existence is a torment. However, what really drives him to do such foul deeds is his thirst for dark knowledge. Still unsated from learning the horrifying mystery at the heart of nature that altered him into the being that he is today, Leshrac desires an \"end to it all\" which he believes may allow him to learn this worse mysteries hidden by the Impurities at the heart of existence.",
      "Perhaps this is what motivates him to participate in the war of the Ancients. Should he fail, he will be sentenced to what might possibly be a state of never-ending torment.",
      "Leshrac is the self-proclaimed guardian of the Impurities. On some occasions, he gives them tithes of gold for unknown reasons. It is also unknown what use do the Impurities have for gold. He invokes the Impurities with his actions, possibly to show his devotion to them. Lastly, he seeks an \"end to it all\" which he believes will allow him to learn the worse mysteries that they hide.",
      "Leshrac swears allegiance or subservience to no one. Thus he serves no higher power or entity other than nature itself.",
      "Grimstroke considers it a waste to kill Leshrac, because he had plans to recruit him to his side. What he plans to do alongside the nihilistic elemental is currently unknown.",
      "This evil nihilistic creature is disliked and reviled by many people. By his own word, he is a mass murderer and may have committed genocide.",
      "Leshrac once did something to a woman acquainted with  Pangolier, angering him greatly. While Dont\u00e9 let him live at that time, he swore an oath to kill Leshrac in revenge, if he ever saw him again. It's interesting to note that Leshrac's nihilism, which encompasses torment and suffering, clashes against Dont\u00e9's hedonism.",
      "Hoodwink doesn't like Leshrac. She seems to be familiar with his kind and is surprised to see him besides the others that she has met, and she has a very bad relationship with an unnamed female character who will get mad at her for killing Leshrac.",
      "Leshrac's previous form from when he was still a philosopher is unknown, but a remnant of his former appearance can be still be seen in his current form. His face is a good indicator of what he used to be\u2013his most notable facial features are his wide, flat nose and blank yellow eyes\u2013features that can be seen on the Oglodi people. It's also worth noting that the Oglodi were once an intellectual race consisting of esoteric artists and philosophers, the latter of whom Leshrac was possibly a part of given his background.",
      "Transformed into an evil elemental by the horrifying mystery at the heart of nature, Leshrac is at one with this lurid and vile nature. His form resembles that of a Centaur's body, but its features are twisted and unnatural. Stony outgrowths form his weird looking antlers and the shoulder growths on his equine torso. Unlike the front legs of a horse and other ungulates his front legs have can bend towards and away from his body. He has three-toed hooves and there are runic markings all over his form, of which we know nothing about its meaning. A liminal being, he exists half in the material plane and half in its heart. His body emits a faint glow at all times. Like the horses and other similar ungulates that his form is based from, he may sometimes paw the ground in his idle animation.",
      "His physical form bears host to the same Chronoptic Crystals that allowed him to see the heart of all reality. These crystals jut out of his back, his shoulders, and the back of his skull by default. They are pink or purple in color, and may be the source of his Chronoptic power. The crystals on the back of his head may multiply and grow even longer, replacing his own antlers. These woeful spires are nourished by the waves of Chronoptic energy that passes through his warped mind.",
      "This unnatural form can be warped further by his manifest will. For example, Leshrac's agonizing insights can manifest beyond the mind and onto his body, causing them to burst from deep within. These painful insights manifest as spiky outgrowths that burst out of his flesh, sharing the agony of his mind to the body as well. Leshrac's anguish, black thoughts and foul deeds have made him the host of an evil growth of vines, a twisted kind of wisdom that feeds and thrives off of those three aspects of Leshrac.",
      "A sip of the tainted waters from his nature has irreparably corrupted his body with a motley of unnatural vegetative mutations. The corruption has caused a growth of branches on his arms, which he uses to channel great power through them. There is an unnatural growth of stone-hard fungus on his shoulders and back, and his tail has been transformed into a weapon that \"pulses desolation\" probably referring to his Pulse Nova. The effect has reached his curved horns as well, which permanently corrupts the souls of anyone who touches them.",
      "It's interesting to notice that Leshrac's life can be learned through his death and rebirth. Just like all living creatures, Leshrac's heart holds a spark of life that will fade when he dies. But unlike other living creatures, the life that was given to him by the Impurities is unnatural, and thus even his death is unnatural. Perhaps, his death is unnatural to him since he is reviled by Death itself, a natural end to all living things. Or maybe death purifies impure entities like him because death ends his torment, an inherent impurity deeply rooted within him by the elements that compose him. However, his death isn't permanent, and he returns to the foulest heart of nature when he dies to reform himself.",
      "From the heart of nature, the alignment of his elements are restored and the Impurities unite in him, restoring his form and his unnatural life.",
      "We learn from this regeneration process that Leshrac is composed of the impure elements known as the Impurities, confirming his status as an elemental. We also learn that Leshrac is immortal because death doesn't send him to the afterlife (e.g. the Underscape, the Seven Hells, the heavens, etc.) like any other being. He is reviled and rejected by Death for being so unnatural, thus he is sent back to his cloister at the heart of nature instead when he dies before restoring his life and physical form from there.",
      "Outside of his gameplay abilities, Leshrac's elemental powers seem to focus on debasing the forms of other beings until they are reduced to their fundamental elements. He may also rid other beings of their fundamental elements, and banish their physical form back to the heart of nature where they will meet the Impurities and merge with them  to realize the torment that they always had but were oblivious to all along. Because of all this, he is called \"the impurifier\" whose purpose includes purging the elements.  It's interesting to note that this so-called \"impurifier\" kills people by purifying them. Ah, the duality of Leshrac.",
      "Even our natural world isn't safe from him. Leshrac warps nature to his vile will to blight and blast his surroundings. It is possible that all of these destructive actions against nature and its inhabitants can help him achieve his ultimate goal of bringing the world into utter desolation and chaos.",
      "Leshrac's mastery of the elements and the Chronoptic Crystals allows him to effortlessly manipulate the natural world around him as his weapon. This makes him a powerful being who can destroy entire armies and demolish nature itself with his mere presence.",
      "Twisting nature to his vile will, a  Split Earth is observed as the ground shifts beneath his hooves, opening fissures that consumes his enemies in the earth's chasms. A closer look on this ability shows that it uses Chronoptic energies to work its destructive powers, as seen in the picture to the right. Enemies stricken by this are soiled for some reason, probably because the sudden ground movement discharges the soil around.",
      "Also known as \"Edict of Death\" to himself, his  Diabolic Edict moves Chronoptic energy from one plane to another, manifesting bursts of said energy which evaporates anything it touches.  This evil decree shares Leshrac's impure torment to others.",
      "Leshrac ignites a spark in the skies to summon a massive  Lightning Storm that rains down indiscriminate streaks of lightning upon entire enemy armies. These lightning bolts are very torrid and can ignite enemies upon impact. The lightning's unnatural color may be from his chronoptic energy, but purple lightning is natural in real life, so it might not be the case for this one.",
      "Nihilism has no lore to describe what it does outside of gameplay, besides it being a reference to his nihilosophy.",
      "The body of Leshrac pulsates with waves of damaging energy in a luminous  Pulse Nova, manipulating the spacetime fabric itself to destroy lesser beings."

     "Intro": [
      "In life, the frost-mage Ethreain (not yet a Lich) had used the threat of destructive ice to enslave entire kingdoms. His subjects, aided by a few desperate magicians, eventually grew bold enough to ambush him. Armed with enough charmed rope to bind him forever, they tied the frost mage to adamant weights and dropped him in a pool known chiefly for being bottomless. It wasn't.He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil's plumbline snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings and commenced a simple rite of resurrection. Even the descendants of Ethreain's enemies were long forgotten by time, so there were none to warn Anhil against imprudence. But he learned the error of his judgment almost immediately, as Lich threw off the shackles and consumed him."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Over time, the Lich's frost magic became a catalyst for the otherwordly power within him that began to manifest from within his body as dense ice crystals. These growths began to creep out from his arms and back, seeking to embrace the ice mage himself. To counteract this, he wrapped his body with a length of enchanted cloth that counteracts the growth of this power, preventing it from consuming him.",
      "Lich carries a flask on his waist that pulses with the remains of the warmth that his heart had before he died, where he can keep an eye on it.",
      "Gravity has no pull on the Lich, allowing him to effortlessly hover above the ground even when weighed down with a weighted belt. He wears this belt as a mockery to those who seek to pull the Lich down.",
      "Besides ice magic, Lich has the ability to preserve items to prevent them from rotting and corroding. He uses this power to preserve the charmed ropes, wearing it as a reminder that no one should hope to bind him again.",
      "Ethreain once owned a magic tome in his life. When his rebellious subjects bound him, they shackled the tome to his back and placed a headpiece to blind him so he may never read from its dark pages.",
      "In life, Ethreain sought out the Bloodwhorl Crown. The rumors of the artifact drove him to hunt for the item from kingdom to kingdom, but he failed to acquire it as he was thrown to his demise in the Black Pool. However, he didn't know that the crown cannot be worn by any living creature, and had he accomplished this quest in his mortal form rather than his undead form, it would've been his greatest failure of all.",
      "Lich was involved in the war raging in Roseleaf. He is technically not a direct participant, but he sees it as an embarrassment of riches, as the war has many opportunities for him to take while it goes on: Lion travels to Weeping Rose, seeking asylum in the city to protect himself from the Tyler Estate and the Court of Ristul. Crystal Maiden is on holiday, who may be residing somewhere within Weeping Rose due to her duties as an external collaborator with the Sapphire Conclave. And the Vhoul rebellion, led by the rebel Rix, is currently losing against Stonehall's forces and are willing to do anything to win the fight.

     "Intro": [
      "In the dungeons of Devarque, a vengeful wizard lay in shackles, plotting his escape. He shared his cell with a gibbering creature known as N'aix, a thief cursed by the Vile Council with longevity, so that its life-sentence for theft and cozening might be as punishing as possible. Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape.Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N'aix's body, intending to compel N'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed. Instead, the wizard found his mind caught in a vortex of madness so powerful that it swept away his plans and shattered his will. Jarred to consciousness by the sudden infusion of fresh life, N'aix woke from its nightmare of madness and obeyed the disembodied voice that filled its skull, which had only the one thought: To escape.In that moment Lifestealer was born. The creature cast its mind into dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to open locks and cut down their companions, opening an unobstructed path to freedom while feeding on their lives. Lifestealer still wears the broken shackles as a warning that none may hold him, but on the inside remains a prisoner. Two minds inhabit the single form--a nameless creature of malevolent cunning, and the Master whose voice he pretends to obey."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Even though his past identity and memories have been destroyed, N'aix still retains several aspects of himself when he was still an ordinary thief. He dislikes the concepts of imprisonment, purchase, and control; and is confused when something is given to him freely.\nThe one thought that the wizard gave to N'aix after being trapped in his mind indicates his dislike of control. \"To escape\" might not mean that the wizard is telling N'aix to escape, but the wizard himself actually wants to escape N'aix's mind. This plea fell on deaf ears (or minds in this context) as he only pretends to obey him.",
      "The one thought that the wizard gave to N'aix after being trapped in his mind indicates his dislike of control. \"To escape\" might not mean that the wizard is telling N'aix to escape, but the wizard himself actually wants to escape N'aix's mind. This plea fell on deaf ears (or minds in this context) as he only pretends to obey him.",
      "Despite disliking control and being controlled, he seems to be a hypocrite in that regard. His lack of hesitation on using mind control (e.g.  Infest) is an indicator of this.",
      "N'aix's newfound powers over the life-force of others have given him a malicious and sadistic personality as a side effect.",
      "Already an insane creature himself, N'aix finds nothing disgusting in the awful things that he does to satisfy his wicked needs and desires.",
      "Reborn in the foul dungeons of Devarque, N'aix the Lifestealer unleashes himself upon the world to continue the thievery that he was once punished for in his previous life. N'aix is not of a single mind, but rather an unnatural mingling of two minds that inhabit a single body. Combining the newfound strength of N'aix and the life-force magic of a nameless wizard, it's only a matter of time until N'aix releases the essence of his victims to feed him and his master.",
      "In the dungeons of Devarque, there was a vengeful wizard imprisoned within its walls and bars. This unnamed wizard shared a cell with a gibbering Oglodi named N'aix, a thief cursed by the Vile Council with longevity, so that its long life in captivity may be as punishing as possible. Such was the longevity that was placed on him, that he could live for many generations of the nobles of Devarque, thus succumbing from old age will never be an escape from the torment that he will receive for the rest of his sentence.",
      "The thief's mind was broken from the countless cruelties that the nobles of Devarque and their descendants had visited upon him, each method being different from the previous one. But even though his broken mind could not understand why he was being punished, nor could he even fathom the meaning of punishment, the methods of torture were still different from the last, maintained by the wicked creativity of Devarque's nobles and progeny.",
      "Finding a great opportunity for his escape plan, the wizard set his schemes to action. He would weave a spell of Infestation: a spell that will cast the wizard's life-force into a victim's body, allowing him to control N'aix against his own will. After compelling him to attack the guards and set a commotion, he would return to his body and creep out unnoticed. Casting his life-force on the creature, he found his mind caught in a vortex of intense madness that swept away his plans and shattered his will, leaving his consciousness trapped within the creature, or whatever was left of his former identity.",
      "Although the spell failed and even backfired, it did not go to waste at all. The botched spell infused N'aix with the life-force of the wizard and he was jolted back to consciousness from his state of insanity and madness. In the first moments of his reawakening, he managed to comprehend a voice in his head that could only think one thought: To escape.",
      "Thus the Lifestealer was born, a mingling of two wicked minds inhabiting a single vessel. Heeding the thought of escape, Lifestealer cast his mind into the dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to break open the locks and cut down their companions, leaving a trail of chaos and bodies for him to feast on. At end of this trail, Lifestealer escaped from the dungeons of Devarque, free to continue its thievery once more: not of gold and possessions, but of the sweet life-force that flows within every living creature.",
      "He wears his broken shackles in plain sight as a reminder that none should hope to contain him, a sick irony that is belied by his physical form: a prison of tortured flesh containing a disembodied consciousness that he only knows as the Master, whom he only pretends to obey.",
      "N'aix once sought an enchanter who could craft a set of vile augmentations to strengthen his twisted body. But his feats and reputation have reached the ears of many people far and wide, and the task of finding an enchanter that would even offer their services to one so evil and insane as N'aix would prove difficult to complete. He finally found a disgraced enchanter's apprentice who had an interest in the darker arts of augmentation. N'aix gave him a commission to craft a set of augmentations for his body, including a set of claw blades and a skeletal backpiece that when opened, revealed a pulsing blob of flesh.",
      "The enchanter's apprentice got to work and managed to forge the requested augmentations and attached them onto N'aix's body, further strengthening his form and twisting his silhouette into something unrecognizable from his previous self. The last piece was a monstrous looking muzzle that was secretly attached with a controlling agent that would allow him to control the Lifestealer after performing a ritual. Attaching the muzzle onto the maw of the Lifestealer then performing the ritual, he realized too late that the controlling agent never bound itself to the muzzle during the ritual\u2013not at all.",
      "N'aix frequently refers to the Master, who is the same wizard that shared his cell and attempted to control him.",
      "N'aix is an Oglodi. This is evident in his facial features: he has a wide flat nose, yellow eyes, and pointed ears. His skin color has a light shade of brown, indicating that he is an unblooded type of Oglodi. This could make sense seeing how an Oglodi can only become blooded when they have participated in war, whereas N'aix has only engaged in theft before he was imprisoned.",
      "Although his broken body would say otherwise, N'aix is a Strength hero, an embodiment of overwhelming force and great durability. He relies on his blood soaked claws to dig into the opponent's flesh and release their essence to him, but he also has a disfigured set of jaws lined with wicked teeth. It should be noted that his longevity might have preserved him in his current state, his skin color remained pristine even after many generations that should have turned him into a rotting, discolored corpse.",
      "With the help of an enchanter's apprentice, N'aix acquired a set of bodily augmentations to further strengthen his form. His augmentations include a skeletal backpiece that opens to reveal a fleshy blob, a pair of metallic claws, and a muzzle that appears to have twisted his visage into a canine-like creature with a long tongue. Without taking the cosmetic's spell effects into consideration, the effects of these augmentations, to what extent do they augment his form and powers, and any new powers that he gained from these items are unknown.",
      "N'aix got his powers when the wizard inadvertently trapped himself within his mind. Thanks to this chance encounter, he can now control the life-force of others to his liking by wielding the wizard's magics to a greater extent than its original caster.",
      "It's unknown if  Rage actually gives N'aix spell immunity or any protection from magic without considering gameplay mechanics, since its lore does not state that anywhere at all. At best, it is simply a state of frenzy and bloodlust that N'aix undergoes during battle, suddenly making him vicious and relentless against his opponents.",
      "Feast is a translation of N'aix's carnivorous appetite and sustenance from life-force into a passive ability. It may be possible that N'aix can leech one's life-force with every strike that he lands on his victim. His ability to deal a percentage of his victim's max health is a gameplay mechanic, however.",
      "Unfortunately,  Ghoul Frenzy has no written lore to even speculate its capabilities outside of gameplay.",
      "Open Wounds is quite a gruesome ability with some form of ludonarrative dissonance. N'aix rends the flesh from his opponent, which causes them to bleed profusely. The scent of blood then attracts scavengers to finish off the bleeding victim as they share in the victim's life-force, just like how the ability allows his allies to steal life with any attacks and any spells that they inflict on his victim. Lorewise, this wouldn't make any sense as not every hero allied with N'aix is comfortable with stealing his victim's life-force in a rather gruesome method, not to mention that spells being able to steal life-force from a simple wound makes no sense. It may simply be set aside as gameplay mechanics.",
      "Infest is heavily implied to be Infestation, the same spell that the wizard cast on N'aix to control him. But since the wizard has been trapped and absorbed into N'aix's being, he now wields this magic to his own ends. By casting his life-force into an unfortunate victim, he can infest their body and wait inside before bursting in a gory explosion. He may even choose to control/attack his victim from within. In N'aix's biography, he also uses this ability to cast his mind into the dungeon's inhabitants to control them against their will."

The exasperated parents of these incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads, losing one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life would be simpler if the children were separated. As the oldest, Lina was sent far south to live with a patient aunt in the blazing Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved more than comfortable for the fiery Slayer. Her arrival made quite an impression on the somnolent locals, and more than one would-be suitor scorched his fingers or went away with singed eyebrows, his advances spurned.

With powers surpassed only by his ambition, the mage was seduced by a demon and turned to evil, trading his soul for prestige. After committing horrible crimes that marred his soul, he was abandoned. The demon betrayed him, striking better deals with his enemies. Such was Lion\u2019s rage that he followed the demon back to Hell and slew it, ripping it limb from limb, taking its demonic hand for his own. However, such demonoplasty comes at a cost. Lion was transfigured by the process, his body transformed into something unrecognizable. He rose from Hell, rage incarnate, slaying even those who had once called him master, and laying waste to the lands where he had once been so adored. He survives now as the sole practitioner of the Demon Witch tradition, and those who present themselves as acolytes or students are soon relieved of their mana and carried off by the faintest gust of wind."

He defeated him after a long battle and harvested his hand for a fresh demonoplasty. Just like the effects of his late demon partner's hand, Lion was afflicted with Malignant Corruption, causing shards of obsidian to grow from his body and made him even more unrecognizable from his original form.",
      "Lion used to be a high ranking ambassador for Hell. He was granted his uniform by a grateful demon populace and carries the scepter Strifemaul to emphasize the important points of his argument, probably through violence or actual emphasis.",
      "Lion wears a ruby ring that can scorch the very soul of its wearer. Fortunately, his soul is already damned and corrupted, so it has no effect on him. He also has a physical third eye that allows him to peer past reality to view the vile powers beyond it.",
      "The Fin King's Charm is one of the many items in Lion's possession. Once used by the Fin King's arcanists to banish targets into the underwater realm, it has lost its core ability and much of its potency, but it still has enough power to turn targets into a fish.",
      "After slaughtering the Order of the Crystal Echelon, Lion prepared to kill the enraged Vidmar, the head of his now-defunct order. With his final breath, he cursed the demonic hand of Lion once he was struck by its spell (which also strengthened his curse), infusing it with Crystal Rot. Only by fusing the Prelate's headpiece to his hand was Lion able to temporarily slow down the effects. Soon, he must find a permanent solution to rid himself of the curse, but for now...it seems that Lion has some new magic to try out.",
      "Each life that Lion takes with his demonic hand feeds the demonic transfiguration of his body and magic, infusing them with the aspects of his late demon partner.",
      "Lion asked The Quorum to grant him harbor in Weeping Rose and did receive it.",
      "Nyx Assassin hints that Lion must earn the grace of Nyx, suggesting that Lion has some knowledge of the queen goddess.",
      "Before Lion became an acolyte to the Grandmaster of the Demon Witch, he used to tend sheep for his family.",
      "Lion has met Donte Panlin before, and is greatly disliked by him. Donte warns him that if they should ever meet again, there would be consequences.",
      "While the Bronze Legion and the Red Mist fought their wars, Lion had his own conflict to deal with. Hunted by the Court of Ristul for his transplanted demonic hand and the Tyler Estate for his unholy usage of magic, Lion sought asylum in the Weeping Rose. He must first seek out the Emissary of the Quorum, who will hear his plea for asylum. In exchange for that, he may share his secrets to the Quorum.",

      "Sylla, the Lone Druid"
     ],
     "Intro": [
      "Long before the first words of the first histories there rose the druidic Bear Clan. Wise and just they were, and focused in their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order. The arch forces of nature saw this, and so sought the most learned among them. Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end of ages, plant the Seed.'As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places.Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "With his mission requiring him to wait for the end of all things, Sylla has vast patience, knowing that all things will have their time.\nHe is patient with rune usage, reserving these powerful magics for later crucial moments.\nPatience is a virtue that Sylla possesses, and so he teaches others to be just like him. As such, he dislikes impatience.\nEven with the vast amount of time that Sylla must wait out for the end, he still doesn't waste a single moment.",

      "The Lone Druid is extremely dedicated to his mission, doing whatever it takes to see to its accomplishment and suffering no threats to his quest.",
      "Although Sylla was an elder when he accepted the Seed, he has become far older with it, seeing through life as an immortal. All mortal lives are so short to him.\nHe brags to the  Witch Doctor that he is much older, scoffing at what Zharvakko calls the old ways.\nHe asserts to the  Outworld Destroyer that he will outlive his ill omens of doom.",
      "He brags to the  Witch Doctor that he is much older, scoffing at what Zharvakko calls the old ways.",
      "He asserts to the  Outworld Destroyer that he will outlive his ill omens of doom.",
      "Possessing wisdom gained from his long years and the Seed, Sylla is immensely wise. He humbles others for their lesser wisdom, but also humbles himself when he errs.",
      "Aeons of existence that appear to have no end in sight have made him curious to know what the end of everything and the conclusion of his sacred mission is.\nHe believes the  Death Prophet has the answer to what the end of his eternal life is. This may imply that he's tired of life or he's just curious on what eternity's end is like.\nAlso, he sounds quite eager when knowing about any progress to the end of the world, but not because he's evil.",

      "Also, he sounds quite eager when knowing about any progress to the end of the world, but not because he's evil.",
      "While traversing the vastness of nature alone, Sylla has learned to be careful with what he does, knowing that hope for the next life after everything has died lies with him.",
      "Sylla is a person who is at one with the untamed aspect of nature. He believes in the survival of the fittest, just like in nature.",
      "Sylla is also at one with the tame and gentle side of nature. Just like the druids of the Bear Clan, he makes his home in nature and takes walks in the forest.",
      "Sylla's true form is that of a bear, thus it's part of his nature to act as a bear, even in his humanoid form. In battle, he tends to let out a bear's roar.\nNormally, he prefers to eat freshwater fish, but he may take the briny fish that  Tidehunter lugs around.\nIn his bear form, he may refer to any handlike item as a paw, such as the  Hand of Midas ---> Paw of Midas.",

      "In his bear form, he may refer to any handlike item as a paw, such as the  Hand of Midas ---> Paw of Midas.",
      "For some nature-related reason, Sylla sometimes thinks of himself as a plant. He metaphorizes his return to the living as a regrowing plant or a plant taking root again.",
      "Having spent millenia alone in exile, Sylla hasn't engaged in combat for a long time. As such, he finds fighting quite thrilling.",
      "Despite finding thrill in fighting after a long hiatus, he sometimes prefers to not fight. He will intimidate, discourage, or make his enemies reconsider their wisdom.",
      "Sometimes, after killing others, he will share to his enemies the same oblivion that fell upon Bear Clan and the loneliness that he endured in his exile.",
      "Having spent so much time in exile with only his bear at his side, he is unfamiliar with the experience of having people by his side, but welcomes it nonetheless.",
      "Coming from a lost order that once practiced sacrifices solemnly, Sylla still honors the sacrifices of others, such as with creeps and the gold they leave behind when slain.",
      "Gold has little to no use to Sylla who lives in poverty. He doesn't recognize any currency and debases any gold coins that he finds to just minerals in another shape.\nWhen concluding a monetary transaction, Sylla may say that he prefers to barter for his items.",
      "When concluding a monetary transaction, Sylla may say that he prefers to barter for his items.",
      "The visions of Serpent Clan's doom, portended to him by their haruspex, brought him a sense of destined calm. When they were destroyed, he became calm in spite of their end.",
      "Sylla honors the memory of his clan by clinging on to the remains of their traditions and the memories of his fellow druids. The ways he does this are listed below:\nLike his clan, Sylla still practices simplicity. He is poor and an outcast to society; wearing simple clothing, having little to no use for money and dwelling in forests of nature.\nThe crescent sickle is a symbol and ritualistic tool of Bear Clan, possibly for grisly augury rites involving disembowelment. He bears a sickle like this as his weapon of choice.\nSylla still keeps the Cloak of the Dawn appointed to him in accordance with the teaching that each rising sun is a gift that is to be greeted.\nAs a warrior of the Bear Clan, Sylla still has the armor he earned after completing the rite of carrying a newborn on a satchel on his shoulder for 11 days to prove his strength.\nLost and lonely during times of doubt, Sylla reacts to the tribulations he faces by praying to the memory of Nuranu's advice, the most honored of his Bear Clan ancestors.\nThe arts of the lost Bear Clan remain only in the mind of Sylla, who continues to study and master them to enhance his attunement with the wild.\nSylla still remembers the high clan lords who ruled with a majestic scepter in their hands.",

      "Sylla still remembers the high clan lords who ruled with a majestic scepter in their hands.",
      "It's interesting to note that, besides cosmic beings like the Fundamentals, Elder Titan is allied with nature heroes (Lone Druid and Treant Protector) and earthy heroes (Earthshaker and Tiny) for some unknown reason.",
      "Both the Elder Titan and Sylla have similarities between them. Although the scope of their missions are different, they both strive to mend the world. They also have similar beliefs on returning creations to their origin, such as the former returning all souls to the ultimate order that once was and returning material things to the earth from whence they came, and the latter having the same thing with returning stuff to the earth.",
      "Despite this, they may be friends just on the basis that they are both animal-aligned shapeshifters. Sylla may also like Banehallow's wolves for once.",
      "Banehallow seems to be curious about whether Sylla was originally a bear before he became a man or a man before he became a bear.",
      "If the time calls for it, Sylla can  Return his Spirit Bear back to his side via teleportation.",
      "His bear's  Entangling Claws can cause roots to burst from the ground and enwrap victims to restrain them.\nWith the wildest power of Xahryx's cauldron, it also summons antlers to entrap his targets for some reason.",
      "With the wildest power of Xahryx's cauldron, it also summons antlers to entrap his targets for some reason.",
      "Demolish has no lore to it.",
      "Alone stands Sylla the Lone Druid amongst the forgotten ruins of his prehistoric Bear Clan. Long ago, the forces of nature sought the most learned in nature's workings and Sylla stepped forth to answer. Given to him alone was the charge of protecting the Seed that it may fulfill one purpose: to sow it upon desolate land and sprout new life when the singularity of life bereft has come for the world. Hope for the planet's renewal after its utter desolation lies in this man, even when no one's around to root for him as he outlives us all.",
      "Many were the places that the exiled Lone Druid chanced upon as he waited out the terminus of life's path in the great wheel of this world. One of these was this shadowy Onyx Grove, a darkling woods found amongst an enigmatic, northern pine. The Grove was a nexus for both fierce and strange creatures who have come here to quarrel in disharmony. In time, Sylla adapted his own form to suit whatever needs he may have in there and soon he joined the chaos as a massive bipedal bear.",
      "At some point in time in his long, self-imposed exile to keep his burden safe, a great evil named Xahryx fell upon the forest with malicious intent. Sylla battled this foul force, grappling them for long until he rent the evil asunder with his paw. Although Xahryx was slain, their dark power still remained in the world, ripe for the picking. Lest that another evil may exploit their wildest power once again, Sylla claimed their cauldron for himself to put the depths of its power to heroic purpose and wore their skull as a trophy of their battle.",
      "As clan judiciar, seer, and warrior of the forgotten Bear Clan, Sylla was like his fellows in focusing on their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order and restore the world.",
      "Alone without his kin, and his precious and coveted burden forcing him to seek further solitude for its safety, Sylla's mighty  Spirit Bear is now his only true companion and friend that shall follow him to the end. It is a projection of his will and hence it is an extension of his own being. Like an extra, distant, complex limb that he can control remotely. Hence, it's a male bear that's symbiotic with his spirit and heart.",
      "Dawnbreaker mistakenly thought that the bear is the primary between it and Sylla since she finds it more interesting than him.",
      "According to  Earth Spirit, the Spirit Bear fights for the earth itself.",
      "In accordance to the laws of nature, such as the great wheel, the fallen in Sylla's wake must return to the earth from whence they came.",
      "The mighty bear is the king of the forest, possessing the throne through its raw power. The  Monkey King disagrees with this, asserting that only he shall rule over nature.",
      "Both  Beastmaster and Sylla are nature's protectors, making them allies. However, their dominions over the woods are dissonant, making them compete for power.",
      "Upon meeting Sylla,  Grimstroke will tell him that he's sure that he has met another druid besides him before. It's unknown who this druid is or what clan do they belong to.",
      "Sylla is familiar with  Puck, remarking that it hasn't aged much since he last saw it. It has heard of him through rumors of the \"ancient\" Lone Druid, and yet it sees otherwise.",
      "Sylla knows the  Shadow Shaman's dad and the fact that he's dead, telling the former to rejoin him. It's unknown if Sylla is referring to his biological father or his master.",
      "In battle,  Elder Titan beckons Sylla to his side, saying that he's no longer alone with him as an ally. If Sylla dies by his hand, he honors him by spreading ashes on his grave.",
      "Although  Sven spends his existence mostly alone and usually goes rogue, he finds a kindred spirit in Sylla and considers it an honor to fight alongside this fellow loner.",
      "Sylla dislikes the Nothl Realm's powers of darkness and criticizes  Dazzle for wielding it.",
      "Despite his similar agelessness and arcana, Sylla disdains the  Invoker. He humiliates the arch-mage by calling him an ignorant child. Even with the magician's depthless magery knowledge accumulated throughout the aeons, Sylla thinks that Carl hasn't gained any wisdom at all. As such, he believes that eternity will be better off without him.",
      "Tinker's crimes against nature with his harmful science is acknowledged by Sylla, who believes that it has done too much damage to nature.",
      "Like other forces of nature, Sylla rejects the blight of  Venomancer and his unnatural  Plague Wards' presence in the wilderness.",
      "The evil Xahryx was once slain by Sylla who defended the woods from their malice. The latter took their wild cauldron for more heroic purposes and wore their skull as a trophy.",
      "The sickle is the Lone Druid's weapon of choice, because it is a symbol and a ritualistic tool of the Bear Clan.",
      "Studying and mastering the arts of his lost Bear Clan, Sylla and his Spirit Bear can let out a terrifying  Savage Roar as a product of his attunement with the wild.",
      "Both Sylla and his Spirit Bear can fly into a rage and go utterly  Rabid as they maul their opponents with speed, a trait not often associated with bears.",
      "As he studies and masters the arts of the lost Bear Clan, Sylla further enhances his  Synergy and attunement with the wild, including his Spirit Bear.",
      "With the greater voice of his True Form, Sylla can unleash a  Battle Cry that's loud enough to reverberate across far distances, rallying his allies to conflict."

Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation and months of wandering, her army long dead or worse. As she stood at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an elder branch. Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting dusk. Without a sound, it turned and left. Fury overtook her. Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught. Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods. Yet the full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow.Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat in the open, attentive and waiting. When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged. Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place. She stood, calm and ready. A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest. Stillness. Hooded figures approached. In reverent tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods.She was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the service of Selemene, or leave and never return. She did not hesitate. Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods."

      "Banehallow was noble-born to the house of Ambry, the greatest of the landed castes in the old kingdom of Slom. Before the Fall, as the King's wants grew strange, and his court grew crowded with sorcerers and charlatans, the house of Ambry was the first to rise against the avarice of the throne. No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head.Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. \"Do this,\" the king said, \"so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.\" Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword. Now the heir to the lost house of Ambry, Banehallow wanders the trail as the Lycan, part warrior, part wolf, in search of justice for all that he lost."

      "The master-smiths of Mt. Joerlak agree on only a single point: that the horn of a magnoceros is more precious than any alloy. And of all such horns, the largest and sharpest belongs to the beast they call Magnus. For half a generation, Magnus took easy sport goring hunters come to claim the treasures of his kin. Each time he would return to his cave with hooves and horns stained red, until his Matriarch urged him and all their kin to seek refuge to the north beyond the shadow of the mountain. But Magnus scoffed, having never failed to defend his people. The magnoceroi would stay, he decided, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance\u2026 nor does it ever change its mind.But when Mt. Joerlak erupted without warning, and half his kin perished in the fire and ash, Magnus changed his mind after all. The survivors pushed north, until they reached a blockade watched over by a hundred hunters armed with bow and steel. Magnus expected no less. He led his fiercest brothers and sisters in a charge against their enemies, and fought with a ferocity matched only by the fire-spewing mountain at his back. Meanwhile the magnoceros elders, mothers, and calves vanished into the drifts. The master-smiths are divided about what happened next.Some say Magnus reunited with his kin, while others claim he suffered mortal injuries and expired alongside the body of his Matriarch. Neither theory is correct. Magnus did vow to rejoin his kin\u2026but only after seeking out those responsible for the eruption of Mt. Joerlak and watching them die upon his horn, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Magnus is a proud member of his race. His endangered race (and those among them who have died) and his vows to avenge and restore them never leaves his mind.",
      "Magnus is a very stubborn creature. He doesn't change his mind and is staunch in his oaths and beliefs and doesn't believe in chance, but his beliefs may be challenged by dire events. Still, he is able to recover and renew his beliefs quickly, as not even Death or a volcanic eruption that wiped out half of his kin was able to permanently change his way of thinking.",
      "Magnus is proud of his own horn. He is aware of how precious it is compared to other things and he appreciates the reactions of awe and jealousy towards his horn, but a line is crossed if anyone tries to touch it.",
      "Magnus is a noble creature. He protects the defenseless and detests those who exploit their inherent weakness. On the other hand, he never gets sated from killing the fools and weaklings who cross him and he believes in and enforces the rule of nature, which has no room for weaklings.\nIt may look contradictory and even hypocritical, but Magnus only defends the meek and slays the kind of weaklings who try to cover their weakness with false power, like those who are opportunists or subjugate lesser beings and those who overestimate themselves.",
      "It may look contradictory and even hypocritical, but Magnus only defends the meek and slays the kind of weaklings who try to cover their weakness with false power, like those who are opportunists or subjugate lesser beings and those who overestimate themselves.",
      "Magnus has a gift for saying the right things at the right time.",
      "When he is equipped with the Shock of the Anvil, he instead casts out a wave of piezoelectric force. Such power was accumulated into the anvil over an entire generation worth of crafted weapons, each one imparting some vital essence as they were battered and shaped upon it until it crackled with piezoelectric power.",
      "It's possible that Reverse Polarity actually manipulates magnetism to work its power.",
      "Among the magnoceroi of Mount Joerlak, there are none so fierce and staunch as Magnus. He alone holds the greatest horn among them all and puts it to great use by goring anyone who dares to hunt down his kin for their precious horns, maintaining his noble vigil for half of a generation. A great calamity brought his brethren to the state of being endangered, leaving him even more determined to preserve them.",
      "Having cast himself away from his own kin to avenge the fallen, he has vowed to hunt down those who were complicit in endangering his brethren. He wields the powers of his people in the form of his pike, horn, hooves, and their magics, as well as the power of the very mountain that destroyed them to reciprocate justice and righteous retribution.",
      "Just like the horns of their race, the master-smiths of Mt. Joerlak agree on only a single point: that the horn of a magnoceros is more precious than any alloy. If the horn of a typical magnoceros is silver, then the horn of the one they call Magnus is gold. For half a generation, this fine warrior fiercely protected his kin from the hunters and poachers who coveted the horns of his kin, until his Matriarch urged him and his entire brethren to seek refuge to the north beyond the reach of the mountain's shadow. But Magnus dismissed her advice, having never failed to defend his people. The magnoceroi would stay, he decided, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance\u2026nor does it ever change its mind.",
      "Magnus would soon find his beliefs challenged when Mt. Joerlak erupted without warning. Half of his kin perished in the fire and ash, prompting him and the other survivors to head north as their Matriarch once decided. They reached a blockade watched by a hundred hunters armed with bows and steel, much to his expectations. It was Magnus who was at the vanguard of the charge, leading his fiercest brothers and sisters against their enemies, while he fought with a ferocity that could only be matched by the erupting volcano behind him. Meanwhile the magnoceroi elders, mothers, and calves vanished into the drifts. The master-smiths were divided about what happened next.",
      "Some may speculate that Magnus did rejoin his kin, while others claim that he succumbed to his injuries and died beside the body of his Matriarch. Nay, neither of these theories are correct. Magnus vowed to rejoin his kin, but only after he finds those who were complicit in the eruption of Mt. Joerlak and skewers them on his horn. After all, a magnoceros does not believe in chance, even against a so-called natural calamity.",
      "Much time has passed since the calamity that befell his people. Although Magnus was single-minded towards those who hunted his kin, he has found a new cause in the strife within Roseleaf Forest. Magnus has sympathized and sided with the Vhoul, whom he believes are being objectified as a commodity by their colonizers, the nation of Stonehall. He also took a young Ilexa under his protection, for he believed that she is destined for something great, and he must see to it that it is realized.",
      "In the three-way war that stirs within Roseleaf, Magnus has chosen the side of the Vhoul and its protectors, such as the  Treant Protector.",
      "He has also become Ilexa's protector and has brought her to the Prowlers for protection.",
      "He likes working with  Sven, likely because of the synergy between their anti-army abilities. Sven shares the same sentiments as well.",
      "Magnus is respected by the  Centaur Warrunner for his strength. This seems a bit contradictory though, because Bradwarden is a poacher, a kind of person that Magnus detests.",
      "Magnus hates poachers and other people similar to them.",
      "Because of his alliance with the Vhoul and their protectors, he is hostile towards the Bronze Legion of Stonehall and the Red Mist Horde.",
      "The horn of Magnus is a recipient of an ancient crystal enchantment that dates way back to the cold, dark heart of the last ice age. This enchantment is a mark of distinction that is only given to the greatest warriors of the magnoceroi.",
      "The spirit of his magnoceroi people dwells within Magnus, and with them is their vast strength. He can tap into their power to work his magic. His connection to his late brethren goes deep enough to reach the immortal spirit of Ardenok to summon him and lend his strength from beyond the grave for an unknown but terrible price. Because of his spiritual power, he is considered a shaman.",
      "Magnus' powers are a combination of his natural talents, the manipulation of Mount Joerlak's forces, and spiritual magic.",
      "The  Shockwave that Magnus has is but a shadow of the violent vibrations emitted by the unstable Mt. Joerlak. He is accustomed to being in the presence of this volcano, so he took the opportunity to use it as a source of power, learning how to channel its reverberations.",
      "Tapping into the strength of his lineage, Magnus lets out a deep bellow to  Empower anyone fortunate enough to call him an ally.",
      "Thanks to its size, Magnus' horn can  Skewer multiple opponents through it.",
      "Horn Toss has no lore to it.",
      "Reverse Polarity is Magnus' most mysterious ability with its lack of explicit lore. Its description states that it changes properties of matter to suck in nearby opponents towards him but the exact properties of matter being manipulated are unknown. Its lore merely compares Magnus' fighting spirit to an erupting volcano."

Just and unjust... Always cruel. So much like his father, Mars indulged his basest impulses--with inclinations much more monstrous than those of Zeus--and he inflicted suffering untold.But as the epochs vanished behind him, the selfish ways of his father--the ways of many amongst his godly kin, they who judged him despicable--eventually began to ring hollow. War for its own sake was no longer enough to satisfy his desires. For the first time in his ageless days, the god of war began to question to what ends he swung his glorious spear.As the Fates would have it, his solution came easily: he must wage war for a larger purpose, and inspire more than mere savagery and sorrow at the sight of his crest. He must at last lay claim to the mantle of leadership that is his birthright, for the time has come to burn down the pantheon of the old age and build a just new empire atop the ashes of his kin. Only then might he find satisfaction, and make the glory of Mars evident to all."

The villagers returned to normal after this, and Mars expects that they rejoiced greatly with songs dedicated to Mars.",

      "Beauty is power. This thought comforted Medusa--the youngest and loveliest of three beautiful Gorgon sisters, born to a sea goddess--because she alone of the sisters was mortal. It comforted her, that is, until the day masked assailants invaded the Gorgon realm and tore the two immortal sisters from their home, unmoved by their beauty or by their tears. One of the invaders seized Medusa as well, but then cast her aside with a disgusted look: 'This one has the mortal stink upon her. We have no use for that which dies.' Humiliated, enraged, Medusa fled to the temple of her mother and cast herself before the goddess, crying, 'You denied me eternal life--therefore I beg you, give me power! Power, so I can dedicate what life I have to rescuing my sisters and avenging this injustice!' After long thought, the goddess granted her daughter's request, allowing Medusa to trade her legendary beauty for a face and form of terrifying strength. Never for a moment has Medusa regretted her choice. She understands that power is the only beauty worth possessing--for only power can change the world."

      "\"If you ask me, life is all about who you know and what you can find. When you live up in the Riftshadow Ruins, just finding food can be tough. So you need to cut corners, you need to scrounge, you need to know your strengths. Some of the beasts up there can kill you, so you need a way to trap the weak and duck the strong. On the upside, the ruins have history, and history is worth a lot to some people. There used to be a palace there, where they had all these dark rituals. Bad stuff. If you survived the ceremony, they would shatter a crystal and split your soul into pieces. They made great art though! Sculptures and such. Let me tell you: sometimes you stumble onto some of those old carvings. Take a pack full of those to town and sell them, then get yourself food for a few weeks. If luck is really on your side, you might find a Riftshadow crystal. Get it appraised and start asking around. Someone always knows some crazy fool looking for this kind of thing. If all else fails, sell it to a Magus the next time one's in town. They love that stuff. Still, whatever you do, be careful handling those crystals. You do not want one to go off on you. It really hurts.\""

Most thought him long dead, tormented by the gods for waging war against the heavens until naught but his legend survived. But, as the stories go, the Monkey King cannot die.So he waited. Until the gods came to offer a chance at absolution, he endured. And when they did come to name the price, Sun Wukong accepted their charge: he would accompany a young acolyte on a secret pilgrimage, protect him from demons and dangers of the road, and guide the man home in possession of a coveted relic. Do that, and humbly obey the human's commands in service to their holy mission, and Wukong would prove himself reformed.For a change, Sun Wukong fulfilled his oath to the gods with honor, and atoned for the sins of past insurrections. The acolyte, much learned in hardships, was returned to his home temple, relic in hand; and Wukong-finding himself for the first time in proper standing with any gods of consequence-was content for a short while to give up his old thirst for adventure and glory.

Held in thrall to a distant sun, bound by gravity\u2019s inexorable pull, the massive ball of ice careened through the blackness between worlds, made strange by its dark journey. On the eve of the ancient war of the Vloy, it punched down through the sky and lit a glowing trail across the night, a sign both armies took for an omen. The frozen ball melted in a flash of boiling heat, as below two forces enjoined in battle across the border of a narrow river. Thus freed from its icy stasis, the Morphling was born into conflict, an elemental power at one with the tides of the ocean, capricious and unconstrained. He entered the fight, instinctively taking the form of the first general who dared set foot across the water, and then struck him dead. As the motley warriors clashed, he shifted from form to form throughout the battle, instantly absorbing the ways of these strange creatures--now a footsoldier, now an archer, now the cavalryman--until, by the time the last soldier fell, Morphling had played every part. The battle's end was his beginning."

To fail is to be other than Slithereen.Once most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon. Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities. But in the final battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn. After the long and bloody onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove. Of her hundred Guard, only a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little consequence. What mattered was that treasure was taken. Honor destroyed. And so Naga Siren was cast out. Banished to search for the stolen chalice. Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken. For no amount of gold is equal in honor to the honor she lost."

      "When Verodicia, Goddess of the Woods, had finished filling in the green places, having planted the coiled-up spirit in the seed, having lured the twining waters from deep within the rock, having sworn the sun its full attention to the growing things, she realized that her own time had reached its end, and like one of the leaves whose fate she had imprinted in the seed, she would fall without seeing the fruiting of her dream. It pained her to leave the world bereft, for the sprouts had not yet broken through the soil--and they would be tender and vulnerable to every sort of harm. She found in her seed pouch one last seed that she had missed in the sowing. She spoke a single word into the seed and swallowed it as she fell. Her vast body decomposed throughout the long winter, becoming the humus that would feed the seedlings in the spring. And on the morning of the vernal equinox, before the rest of the forest had begun to wake, that last seed ripened and burst in an instant. From it stepped Nature's Prophet, in full leaf, strong and wise, possessing Verodicia's power to foresee where he would be needed most in defense of the green places--and any who might be fortunate enough to call him an ally."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "The Prophet's disposition is like that of Nature. In equal parts, Nature is both caring and unforgiving. At times, the Prophet may be peaceful and gentle, but those who fail to see the other side of Nature will learn that he is no stranger to violence. Embodying the violent half of Nature, he is ferocious, savage, and punishing if he needs to be.",
      "The Prophet is wise. It is said that he possesses a hoary wisdom and the wisdom of judgment.",
      "Even as an avatar of the woods-goddess, the Prophet occasionally exercises modesty with his appearance.",
      "Going further into this relationship, Kaolin states that the Prophet must revere him. Kaolin also states that Verodicia's prophet is also his greatest prophet.",
      "Just like the Prophet, Kaolin is dedicated to a goddess who is said to tend to all life. It's also interesting that some of the runes left behind by the trail of Kaolin's wheel book are the same as the runes in the Prophet's  Sprout spell.\nHowever, these runes are actually reused assets that are also found in Witch Doctor's  Maledict and  Death Ward, Chen's  Hand of God, the Glyphs of Confusion, utilised by Vanessa, etc. It's possible that these spells using the same runes implies a universal magic system, or simply just reused assets.",
      "However, these runes are actually reused assets that are also found in Witch Doctor's  Maledict and  Death Ward, Chen's  Hand of God, the Glyphs of Confusion, utilised by Vanessa, etc. It's possible that these spells using the same runes implies a universal magic system, or simply just reused assets.",
      "When Verodicia expired, her vast body decomposed throughout the long winter and became humus. It's possible that, with the woods-goddess' remains which is now merged with the earth, Kaolin now fights in honor of the entire Earth which includes Verodicia herself.",
      "It's interesting to note that they both wear rune tablets with similar aesthetics (dark tablets fastened with rope and inscribed with blue runes) if not similar runes.",
      "The rune Laguz (\u16da) means \"water\" or other bodies of water such as \"lake\", \"ocean\", \"sea\" and \"waterfall\", depending on what runic alphabet is being used. Laguz is inscribed on both his necklace and his bracers. In the lore of Nature's own prophet, Laguz may symbolize water as one of the three elements substantial for all life. Laguz may also symbolize water as the essence of the material plane. It may also symbolize the gift of water that Verodicia supplied her seeds with when she lured the twining waters from the aquifers.",
      "The rune Sowilo (\u16cb) means \"sun\" in all three runic alphabets. In the lore of the Prophet, Verodicia had sworn the sun its attention to her developing seeds, gifting them one of three elements essential for life: light. All things born and grown from seeds are sustained by the sunlight. Thus, it is revered and welcomed by all living things.",
      "His necklace and his sigil stones have a rune on them that appears to be a mix of the Dagaz (\u16de) or Mannaz (\u16d7) rune. The former means \"day\" or \"dawn\", while the latter means \"man\" or \"mankind\". When considering the deeper meanings of Dagaz, it may symbolize the morning of the vernal equinox when the Prophet sprouted. It may symbolize cycles in nature, such as the brutal cycle of life or the great wheel, since it resembles an infinity loop between two dualities. The Mannaz rune may symbolize the primal men of the deep forest that the Prophet is affliated with.",
      "Written together on his sigil stones only are runes that resemble Kaun (<) and Ur (\u16a2) from the Elder Futhark alphabet. Kaun has many meanings, such as \"ulcer\" (and other ailments with a burning sensation, such as: abscess, sores, carbuncles, boils, etc.), \"torch\" (which symbolizes the process of learning, discovering new knowledge like a torch in a dark room), and \"fire\" or \"heat\" which both aforementioned words have in common. The first meaning of Kaun makes no sense with his lore, but given that all three meanings share the element of fire or heat, Kaun could symbolize the Prophet's main attribute of intelligence, since fire is oft associated with the stuff of the mind like intelligence, learning, and discovery, like the Invoker's magics of Exort. After all, he is a wise prophet. On the other hand, Ur means \"aurochs\", a wild but extinct bovine known for its strength. This bovine is one of the many animals found in Verodicia's domain.",
      "An interesting detail to note is that this spell casts a ring of 8 random runes beneath the trees that are spawned by this ability. Some of the runes bear a resemblance to the runes of old Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian alphabets (a.k.a. the so-called Norse runes). The runes include fehu and kaun.",
      "These runes can also be seen on the rune trail left behind by Kaolin's wheel book. An interesting detail that further hints at the great relationship between the Prophet, Kaolin, Verodicia, and the Earth.\nHowever, these runes are actually reused assets that are also found in Witch Doctor's  Maledict and  Death Ward, Chen's  Hand of God, the Glyphs of Confusion, utilised by Vanessa, etc. It's possible that these spells using the same runes implies a universal magic system, or simply just reused assets.",

      "Not only can he summon them, but he can even bend them to his will to place them under his complete control.",
      "The Prophet can construct a familiar named Shroom Thing, made from fungus and moss and infused with the Father Mushroom's essence.",
      "He can also summon the Shroomlings to his side. A sentient walking fungi who hail from the Drowned Forest, they are fearless and fond of dark and damp places.",
      "Other treants include the Dendrochron, a species of treant resembling a scary tree stump. Their population is difficult to control even with axe culling.",
      "From the vast remains of Verodicia, the Nature's Prophet sprouts into full leaf, rolling the great wheel of life once more. With the foresight to watch over the creations of his goddess and the power to protect it in times of need, the favored son of Verodicia preserves his life and all of her creations to never squander the fated yet selfless sacrifice that his goddess underwent with great sorrow.",
      "Nature's Prophet was summoned to the side of the ancient forest warden Virga Truebark when she defied the Iron Princeling. Together, nature's guardians fought side by side against their common adversary. The outcome of this fight is currently unknown.",
      "The riverlands hero Castor Twin-Tusks challenged Verodicia's chosen prophet to an arcane duel. Castor lost both the duel and his life.",
      "Nature's Prophet is the favored son of Verodicia. As stated in his biography, he was born from his goddess' last seed which was blessed by her final word before she swallowed it as she died. Like all the other flora that the goddess planted, his seed fed upon her decomposed remains and became the first seed to sprout before the rest of her holy forest. He also claims that he is the reincarnation of Verodicia or even her avatar.",
      "He also has siblings, which includes a bunch of deerlike treants with four legs, akin to the Enchantress. These spry treants, like the Prophet, are one of the first born of the wilderness & have been with him since time immemorial.",
      "Just like the goddess that bore him, the Prophet's domain is the wild forest. He is the staunch protector of all that is natural, his watch over the forest is enhanced by the foresight that Verodicia gave to him. The Prophet is not only a sentinel of the flora, but also a sentinel of all beasts and birds. Keeping his sentinel over the forest, he is always wandering the wide wilderness in search of places that may beckon his aid.",
      "Besides being a guardian of nature, he also rules over his grove as a wise leader. Ruling as a Verdant King, he governs the land with a crown of kingly horns sharpened with the wisdom of judgment.",
      "Judging by the name, the Prophet may be a guard of the tribes that dwell in the deep forest. Unlike their milk-fed cousins, these men are primal, driven by instinct and a will to survive They call upon nature's pantheon, which is bereft of gentle gods. The aforementioned lore and the Celtic-inspired design on the Prophet's bracers may suggest that these savage men are ancient forest druids.",
      "The Prophet is one of the many Heroes that the  Earth Spirit rallies together to defend their planet's lands. These guardians are as follows: the Enchantress, the Lone Druid,  and Ulfsaar. This seems to suggest that there is a hidden faction that is dedicated to the defense of all nature. Kaolin, whose spirit is at one with the planet even after he was cut off from it, claims that he and the Prophet's spirits are alike.",
      "Alongside  Treant Protector, the Prophet is the pride of Verodicia. Despite their relationship, the Prophet does not say anything friendly to Rooftrellen, to the point of him going completely out of character. On the other branch, Rooftrellen calls him a \"little tree\" whenever he meets him, probably because Rooftrellen treats him as his younger sib, even though the Prophet is older than him since he was the first seed in Verodicia's forest to grow.",
      "As a fellow guardian of Nature,  Lone Druid is in good standing with this Prophet. This is evident in the fact that Sylla will feel confused and betrayed if the Prophet attacks or slays him. He also feels dismayed to know that he was forced to kill the Prophet. Sylla tells his Prophet that, regardless of his power or station, even he must respect his mission to plant the Seed, further hinting at his mission's significance even to the forces of nature.",
      "The bounty of Nature is sustained and strengthened by the blessings of the Earth where it holds its roots. Thus, the  Earthshaker and the Prophet are on good terms with each other, with the former respecting the Prophet even in his death. These two share a common understanding of an unknown subject that not all beings get.",
      "Nature's Prophet once tried to recruit  Hoodwink into his affiliation of nature's guardians, but the loner rascal refused his offer, also refusing to be ordered around by him.",
      "Apparently,  Windranger feels regret when killing the Prophet since she knows that he's the son of Verodicia, which hints that they were on good terms with each other.",
      "Just like the Prophet, the  Drow Ranger values the forest and makes her home in it, even claiming it as her personal domain. Thus she may ask for the Prophet's aid in reclaiming the woods. Sometimes, she believes that she is the chosen of the woods, rather than the Prophet. Ever since she put on the  Mask of Madness, however, she dislikes being followed by the Prophet.",
      "At some point in time, the Prophet loyally fought side by side with Virga Truebark against the Iron Princeling.",
      "Enno can call upon Nature's Prophet as one of the many allied Heroes who can help him claim the leaderless White Spire.",
      "The Prophet is ill-disposed towards the Keen and their S.O.L.K., because their science is a blight and an affront to Nature. He expresses his hostilities specifically towards  Timbersaw and  Tinker. These two Keenfolk share the same sentiments as well.",
      "He rejects the presence of  Venomancer and his  Plague Wards in his forest, for they are an unnatural plague on nature.",
      "The Prophet's body reflects everything about nature, which is most prominent in his cervine horns and hooves for feet. Like the deer and other similar ungulates that his body is based from, he may sometimes paw the ground in his idle animation. Despite this mix of humanoid and animalistic features, he is more akin to plant since he sprouted from a seed. His blood is actually sap, and he is sustained by both sunlight and moonlight, just like photosynthesis. As the avatar of Nature's Wrath, he can take on whatever form he pleases. He may choose to appear as tree, occasionally as predator, or when it suits him as prey. Lastly, he can regrow himself like a plant.",
      "Like a healthy plant, the horns of the Prophet are always in bloom. Leaves that may gather upon his body will return to flourishing life. As he travelled the glens and groves of the wilderness, his hairy beard has grown as wild as he is, turning it into a growth of leaves.",
      "Among the aspects of the Prophet's form, his antlers are the most changeable aspect of his body. During festive events, his antlers can be curved into a symbol of peace to compliment his peaceful outfit. To recognize the most majestic and mightiest beast of the forest, he wears the antlers of the biggest species of moose (Alces alces gigas) as a crown, just like how the rest of the moose species\u2013like the Alces and Cameloides\u2013bow before Gigas. He may also wear horns that recognize the prideful zebu and aurochs of Verodicia's wild domain. The Prophet bears a set of kingly horns that symbolizes his station and rule as a Verdant King. It's said that these horns of noblesse symbolize the wisdom of judgment that sharpens these horns. In a time long forgotten, a grateful king once gifted the Prophet with metal horns as thanks for aiding the forest.",
      "The Prophet seems to be fond of his hair, especially his beard and his shaggy bark. He may be modest with braiding his beard but sometimes he's not content with merely one braid as an Avatar of Immortals. His beard can grow so long, its ends can be tied behind him in a loop. It is said that this loop might represent the brutal cycle of life in the wild, but he may have just tied it back so that his long beard won't get in the way of his mayhem. Or perhaps it holds both a symbol and a purpose...",
      "When the Prophet is reincarnated, he will speak about his visit to an unnamed \"dark grey place\" during his interval of death and how he wishes to never see that place again. It is possible that this dark grey place that he speaks of is the same world that he saw which is bereft of light, air and water\u2014the three elements essential for all life. However, this world that he saw without light, air and water may be interpreted as the lifeless and desolate future of our world that he saw using his foresight, distinct from the dark grey place that he has been to during his death. It could possibly be the afterlife, since he uses the color grey to describe it, a colour that he associates with death and deterioration.",
      "Those who are slain by the Prophet will have their remains fed to nature for sustenance, continuing the cycle of life even during battle.",
      "An aspect of Spectre states that a cycle continues when the Prophet is slain. This could be a possible reference to the great wheel that encompasses all living things. This could also suggest that the Prophet is not truly immortal like his divine mother who died before she saw the fruiting of her dream, because they are all included in the great wheel which dictates that all that lives must die and repeat in an eternal cycle.",
      "The woodland prophet's title is derived from his powers of foresight that he inherited from Verodicia. Before she died, the woods\u2013goddess saw her grim fate that she had imprinted in one of the leaves within the seed. This power is now being used by the Prophet to foresee where his attention and aid is needed in the forest.",
      "Before his seed birthed the Prophet, he awoke within this seed and saw his destiny, which he said had many branches. The many-branched destiny that he foresaw may be the same coiled-up spirit that Verodicia planted within the seed, a spiritual plant that has many branches where augural leaves stem from, its many branches possibly signifying the many paths of fate that he can choose from.",
      "The Prophet wears a set of fungi and moss themed apparel that are all infused with the essence of the Father Mushroom. The only piece of clothing that is not fungal in this set is its cuffs made of ironwood, but it is still infused with the Father Mushroom's essence. It's unknown who or what the Father Mushroom is.",
      "During occasions of peace and festivity, the Prophet may attend them with a suitable attire. With horns curved into a sign of peace, his hairy beard is groomed into a light and fluffy beard. He wears a lei about his neck during festive events, the garland being a universal symbol of friendship, peace, and good tidings. He also wears a relaxing, white toga. To complete the outfit, he brings with him a staff wrapped with a Candral-Flower, which is plucked from the heart of the Endless Copse.",
      "Resting upon the shoulders of Nature's own prophet is a ring of runestones, with each of these tablets having blue runes written on them. Some of these runes' meanings are unknown, but some of them resemble the runes of old Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian alphabets\u2014a.k.a. Futhark or the so-called Norse runes. The same runes are also inscribed on his 2 sigil stone bracers. These two sigils bear the signs of an \"Elder Ecology\". Some of these runes are fictional and their meanings are completely mysterious, but the following Futhark runes can be seen on the Prophet's runestones:",
      "The Prophet's wardrobe is replete with both protective armor and decorative armor. Although it is decorative, the flared crest of wood on his shoulders can provide protection against the axe: the bane of the forest. Replacing his default runestones is a druidic ritual crest made of wooden planks. Written on each of these holy planks is a death\u2013prayer to Verodicia and the name of an enemy to the deep forest. To preserve the memory of the fallen Satyr general Al-Fusha, the Prophet wears his spiked and goddess\u2013blessed pauldron, which is all that remains of his lost wargear when he fell in battle. To aid his rule as a Verdant King, he sports ailettes with runes inscribed on them that can give its wearer the strength to carry the heaviest burden. The upper jaw of the late Castor Twin-Tusks rests on his right shoulder as a trophy of the Prophet's victory in their arcane duel. The coat of leaves that he has by default is also a common apparel amongst the Druids of Verodicia. The green cape that he wears as a Verdant King is wrapped in the power of the ancient woods.",
      "His arcane arsenal is replete with many magical staves. The Prophet has a staff capped with a Sinorian/Sinorion gemstone that provides a magical focus for nature's incantations. In the wilderness, there are creatures who sharpen their tusks on woodsy trunks. The Prophet has taken away their tusks and strapped two pairs of tusks on his staff as a warning to those who would damage the tree barks using their tusks. As a Verdant King, he carries a holy staff that is engraved with shining runes that denote the secret name of the woods\u2013goddess.  As a wise prophet with a hoary brand of wisdom, he carries a well\u2013seasoned staff that compliments this wisdom. He also wields a curled plant staff that bears six spectrolite mana focusing crystals, set in gold. Not to mention that he is the proud owner of the  Orchid Malevolence, a garnet rod made from a fire demon's essence, and the  Scythe of Vyse, a powerful relic from the cult of Vyse that has the powers of polymorph.",
      "In some cases, the Prophet sources his staves from nature itself. With his impossibly gentle grip, he pulled out a branch to make a staff without causing the butterflies that were sitting on it to flee. From the gnarliest tree in the Manglewood Forest, he detached a limb from that tree to construct an enchanted wood staff. He also has a journey stick crafted from a gnarled branch that eventually found use as a weapon. Lastly, he has a staff fashioned from a Sufferwood sapling.",
      "Before the Prophet's seed was made to sprout, Verodicia imbued a sapphire gem with a spark of her essence. This gem was a fail-safe left in the wastes of a war-torn land to restore life and restart its cycle in places that may lack it.",
      "All of the Prophet's spell effects appears to share the same yellow-orange or amber colored light, which even extends to the colour of his own attack projectile. What this similarity between his spells and projectiles means is unclear, but it's possible that this color is the magery of the Prophet which relies on and taps directly into the heart of Verodicia's wrathsome will, rather than drawing upon blood magic or mana.",
      "Sprout allows the Prophet to grow a ring of trees to fence in his opponents. Reports of the the Prophet's fury state that he frequently uses this on his attackers.",
      "Teleportation does not have much lore to it, so it can simply be assumed that it is nothing but a teleportation ability.",
      "Nature's Call is but one of the many abilities bestowed upon him by the woods-goddess. With this boon, he has the ability to summon the Treant Guard, a mythical sentient army of the wild. The rune left behind by his staff looks similar to the fehu rune found in old Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian alphabets (a.k.a. the so-called Norse runes). Fehu means \"mobile wealth\" when translated, which is possibly symbolized by the treants. The trees are the wealth and the bounty of nature and the Prophet's magic uproots and animates them, allowing them to move freely. Hence the Fehu rune of mobile wealth.",
      "Calling upon Verodicia's fury, the Prophet summons the  Wrath of Nature to strike down those who might ravage the wilderness, smiting them all with its far-reaching energies. Like all of his default spell effects, the color of this spell's energy is yellow-orange/amber, which might be the manifestation of Verodicia's fury by the Prophet's magery."

While others of the order went out to succor the ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of Pestilence. Proclaiming himself the Necrophos, he travels the world, spreading plague wherever he goes, and growing in terrible power with every village his pestilential presence obliterates."

Even after his transformation into the Necrophos, he appears to still be spreading false promises and preaches to areas he visits, sometimes receiving valuable physical items, or sometimes the very plagued people themselves, offering their lives to him to be reaped, possibly for either ease of transition through death, or salvation.",

      "Of the Night Stalker, there is no history, only stories. There are ancient tales woven into the lore of every race and every culture, of an impossible time before sunlight and daytime, when night reigned alone and the world was covered with the creatures of darkness--creatures like Balanar the Night Stalker. It is said that on the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures perished. All, that is, save one. Evil's embodiment, Night Stalker delights in his malevolence. He created the primal role of the Night Terror, the Boogeyman, and as long as there have been younglings, his is the specter summoned to terrify them. This is a role he relishes; nor are these empty theatrics. He does indeed stalk the unwary, the defenseless, those who have strayed beyond the lighted paths or denied the warnings of their communities. Night Stalker serves as living proof that every child's worst nightmare....is true."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Balanar is a malevolent creature. He seems to relish the role of the Night Terror or Boogeyman that was bestowed upon him by many fearful populaces, even though the Night Stalker simply slays others for their sustenance.",
      "Fitting for someone with immense power, Balanar is a lordly being. Before the First Day extinguished his kin, the creatures that he preyed on grew to worship him and fashioned regalia that symbolized his magnificence. He also dislikes others who claim to have more authority or favor over the night or the moon.",
      "Balanar, the Night Stalker, is an ancient night creature who survived the decimation of his kin on the First Day. As ancient as the primordial darkness that predated daylight itself, his true history is lost to the ages. Only apocryphal stories woven into the lore of every race and culture exist to tell the tale of a boogeyman who stalks in the hours of darkness, invoked by the old stories of the elders to scare younglings into good behavior.",
      "Those who dare to defy these warnings or stand against their fears are only met with their demise, a testimony to the fact that Balanar is not an abstract personification fabricated by the elders to warn their younglings, but a real being in the flesh\u2014and that Balanar himself created that role just for the sake of it.",
      "When the world was barely brightened by the rider of Light, it existed during a period when morning never came to pass and days were known as nights. In this perpetual state of umbra, creatures of darkness reigned unchallenged over the world. Soon after, the first among the prey of these beasts grew to worship their masters, forging armor and regalia to honor their magnificence. Balanar was one of the few among these masters who were gifted regalia by his prey, signifying that he was a very powerful figure among the creatures of darkness.",
      "But soon these great creatures did not reign unmatched, nor did they have any impunity. They found themselves in conflict with the armies of the Children of Light, who took up the Keeper's mantle in bringing light to every corner of the universe, while having their own goal to purge the cosmos of all creatures of primordial night. One of their heralds, Valora the Dawnbreaker, came into conflict with these creatures as well.",
      "On the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures perished. Balanar survived this onslaught due to the sheer amount of darkness residing in his heart that allowed him to sustain himself through daylight (but in a weakened state) leaving him the sole survivor of the event. He now plays the role of the Night Terror, the Boogeyman, punishing those who ignore the tales and warnings of their communities with death, stalking the unwitting and unwary, and striking fear into generations of families and societies with his mere existence.",
      "At some point in time, definitely after the eradication of his kin, Balanar was captured and bound by the Order of Ra'hul with cursed chains that were said to bring his ancient power to heel. Although the Order was initially successful, their prisoner escaped when nighttime fell, restoring the Night Stalker back to full power and allowing him to break free, possibly slaughtering the Order in the process.",
      "Balanar is not involved in any of the events in Artifact, but card art depicts him attacking Enchantress in a dark forest.",
      "As a night creature, Balanar should be hostile towards the Children of Light and their creations, including  Dawnbreaker. These star progeny dispatched many armies to purge the cosmos of all creatures of primordial night, likely resulting in the catastrophic event known as the First Day which killed all the night creatures.",
      "Balanar is a Strength hero, a powerful embodiment of overwhelming force and great durability. A beast of the night, he relies on his claws and teeth to tear at his enemies. He has a pair of membranous wings that he usually unfolds during nighttime to fly untethered from the ground, allowing him to catch up to his prey should they choose to escape from him.",
      "Although he is physically powerful, Balanar is no ordinary beast who merely relies on bodily weapons. He possesses a myriad of ancient powers revolving around fear and shadow to cripple his opponents and bring them to heel. This ancient power makes him an eldritch creature, although not as eldritch as the likes of a faerie dragon.",
      "Lore-wise, Balanar's  Void is a surprisingly powerful skill, if not an actual magic spell. The skill involves Balanar creating a vortex that pulls his enemies into the time period when the primordial darkness was still unlit by the First Day. Its description implies that Void is a time travel ability with offensive capabilities or a form of temporal banishment.",
      "Crippling Fear allows Balanar to transmit a vision of his unhinged mouth into the minds of his victims, horrifying those he deigns to use this ability on. It is so horrifying that nearby spellcasters are silenced. The mental image obstructs their vision, hence the Blind debuff that it used have.",
      "Hunter in the Night is not an actual ability that Balanar has in the lore. It is more of a translation of Balanar being at his strongest during nighttime into a gameplay mechanic.",
      "His ultimate,  Dark Ascension, allows him to summon darkness to turn day into night or extend the duration of nighttime, at least according to its effects in gameplay.",
      "Besides his gameplay abilities (that somewhat have a connection to the lore) and passive skills, Balanar has some other powers found in his lore. He has the ability to call upon the souls of his perished brethren from the void by using himself as their spiritual focus into the material plane, allowing them to haunt the living."

      "Already unique to his own species, whose telepathic abilties render them unique amongst every creature in the seven planes, the Nyx Assassin emerged from his metamorphosis as a powerful arachnid with sharp mandibles, blade-like claws, and a consciousness whose thoughts are as penetrating as its appendages. But he did not have these when he was born. No, the Nyx Assassin is but one of the many zealot scarabs that are chosen by Nyx for metamorphosis, a process that not all scarabs can survive.",
      "After being chosen by Nyx, the zealot scarab is anointed with the queen goddess' extract in her own chambers. If they manage to survive the process, they are reborn as the Nyx Assassin with unique abilities that grant them a unique status and level in their caste. Like most insects, they are composed of chitin, but the Nyx Assassin's body may be modified with other materials.",
      "The Nyx Assassin is naturally armed with many deadly features. His thin, ornate carapace is guarded by a retractable field of razor sharp spikes that dissuades melee attackers from touching him. His sharp mandibles speaks nothing but his bite and his metallic claws help him tear through the soft armor of his targets. However, it is his mind that makes his unique. His subtle, psychic abilities allows him to communicate with his thoughts alone and eat away at the minds of lesser beings.",
      "In some point in time, the Nyx Assassin has undergone several augmentations to its physical body. Over the course of seven seasons, a carapace that granted the Nyx Assassin protection against blade and magic was molded by the slow administration of alchemicals. He also received a stinger and two metallic pincers that were screwed to the ends of his frontal appendages. Lastly, the mystical wand Dagon may be fused into the Nyx Assassin's body as a complement to his abilities.",
      "Besides being susceptible to his goddess' modifications, the Nyx Assassin's body parts may also be interchangeable. He is granted ceremonial body parts (equivalent to ceremonial clothing) such as claws, a carapace, and a horn that are bestowed upon him when he makes his first and third kill. He is also granted the Carapace of the Sacred Orb through painful molting. The carapace holds the Sacred Orb, whose influence allows the Nyx Assassin to perceive more of Nyx's bounty.",
      "The Nyx Assassin also possesses the burrowing capabilities of the typical zealot scarab, but the Assassin caste mainly uses it to ambush opponents and attack unseen. Using this skill, the current incarnation of the Nyx Assassin managed to dig deeper than his predecessors. In doing this, he found a vein of blue luminous crystals that soon coated several parts of his exoskeleton. The crystals increased his power and influence when it was introduced to his hive.",
      "The current Nyx Assassin has loathed Abaddon since the birth of his unique caste. Likewise, it appears that Abaddon has defeated previous emissaries sent by Nyx.",
      "Broodmother has eaten several of Nyx Assassin's fellow zealot scarabs.",

Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre's low rate of reproduction). However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history.With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck\u2014a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself.

     "Intro": [
      "Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade.After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them.The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt."

      "Purist  is  Chaos Knight's second most hunted prey, after  Keeper of the Light.",

      "Purist owns an enchanted helmet forged and worn by the first knights who were blessed by the Omniscience.",
      "Omniknight is in possession of the Wingfall Hammer, a holy warhammer anointed by the All Seeing One to bolster its wielder and their allies.",
      "Purist Thunderwrath the Omniknight is a zealous crusader for who fights for his god, the Omniscience. Outside of combat, Purist may also be a Hierophant, a member of the Omniscience's clergy. He is also a theologist, having knowledge on many gods outside of the one he worships.",
      "Sensing a powerful and hidden evil stirring amongst the war between Stonehall and the Red Mist, Purist sought out Luna of the Dark Moon to form an alliance. With the combined might of their powers and their deities, he hopes to stop the Court of Ristul before their power begins to take influence on anyone."

     ],
     "Intro": [
      "Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.Raised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome's pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings.From the first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school's destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle's notice.The Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif's talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy.At first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, \"It could go either way.\" No firmer statement could he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took \"It could go either way\" to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.Of course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer's words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap's palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.The immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.Long before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us."

For those willing to hear his backstory, prepare yourselves to hear the tale of the great foreseer whose prophecies may be certain, but his intentions are not.",
      "For ages, those who inherited the Great Seat of Cymurri relied on the Oracles, imported to them exclusively from the ancient school of the Ivory Incubarium that was situated high in the hollow peaks of Zealot's Range. Despite this powerful, mystical advantage of having foresight at their side, such power comes at a mere monetary price. Downpayment was made by the time an Oracle's embryo develops, with the remaining balance paid on delivery of a mature, well-trained Oracle to the Gate of the Graven King.",
      "In the Ivory Incubarium, the Oracles are bred and birthed from the Pallid Sybils, who raise and train them until they have come into their own. Using their physical forms as an anchor to the material plane, their souls roamed afar while still being bound by the faintest astral tether. Returning from their cosmic roamings, they would report back with mystic utterances that were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors who found in them visions of the future and diplomatic advice. These prophecies were a powerful resource that the Graven King lineage used to secure victory in every campaign in the court or on the battlefield, filling the pages of the Graventome with the names of successful kings and the domains they have captured. This trend would persist until a certain Oracle named Nerif wrote the last page to signify the end of the stone-helmed kings.",
      "At first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. Most Oracles speak of what they see in the future, but Nerif spoke of the future as if he was shaping it with his words. He croaked out advice that no one requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves in conflicts with new enemies. Sensing a threat to their power, the Cymurri blamed Nerif and demanded his removal. They appealed to the Sybils to replace their defective prophet with a worthy substitute. But Nerif portended an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and news of its destruction in an avalanche came a few hours later. Fearing that they may face the same fate as the Pallid Sybils and their school, the Cymurri Advisors retreated to their counsel chambers, away from the harbinger's notice.",
      "But the incumbent Graven King was a practical and opportunistic person. Where his advisors saw bad tidings and the ability to realize them, the Graven King saw only the latter in this strange augur.

With a superficial understanding of his power, he persuaded Nerif to utter his wishes as prophecy.",

He thought his prophecy meant that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.",
      "Perhaps the Graven King should've taken the sayer's words more literally, but knowing what had happened after that, it wouldn't change anything. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Satrap's palace was impossible to visualize. In the midst of the skirmish, Nerif had literally split reality, dividing the battle's every moment into two outcomes as they all played out. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also found themselves unmoved and able to fight, soldiering onward to battle. Even their minds were split into two as they all experienced the state of being both alive and dead, existent and nonexistent, triumphant and defeated.",
      "The Graven King, the Unsated Satrap, and both of their forces could not comprehend a paradoxical situation and they all fell into insanity as the universe became a hall of mirrors that reflected each moment's alternate outcome, endlessly shattering into even more shards of reflection. The opposing but paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite continuums, all of them populated by a populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner.",
      "But before the repercussions could even happen, the wary Cymurri Advisors had seized Nerif, tied him up and sealed his mouth, before placing him in a dimensional barque that was launched out of their universe at high speed, hoping that they could banish him to a place where he could not harm anyone forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And now that his barque has somehow brought him into our universe, it could very well be for us.",

      "The intruder is revealed to be the Phantom Assassin, who has come to slay Nerif for the Veiled Ones. Nerif utters her forbidden name as he taunts her lack of perspective, much to the surprise of his would-be killer. He then tells her the many possibilities that he has seen of this encounter and concludes with the one thing that they all have in common: she has never known why she was sent here to begin with.",
      "Mortred silences the soothsayer as she holds a dagger to his neck and assures him that she has a name to expunge from her list, which is all that she needs to know. Unmoved, Nerif tells her that she is missing something, evident in her refusal to kill him. Something is holding her back and gnawing at her\u2014although her killings have shaped the world around her, she has never known the consequences beyond them and how they've shaped the world as well. Compelled, Mortred asks him about the truths that he could possibly tell her, and the soothsayer responds with a grin on his face.",

He explains that, rather than seeing the patterns of stars as mere shapes of animals or figures, he sees the starry constellations in the sky as a pattern of timelines. To him, these timelines are prophecies that presage his death should they result in it. Although he has died across many timelines, he has taken heed to the ones where his murderers have proven themselves to be the most lethal nemeses to him across time.",
      "Before he could finish his explanation, Mortred makes it known that he wants these people dead. Having reached an understanding, Nerif materializes the Manifold Paradox in his hands and entrusts it to her so that she may be aided in her contract. She then curiously inspects the blade.",
      "Nerif is not involved in any of the events of Artifact, but he is mentioned by Ish'Kafel. Hearing of the Oracle's precognition abilities, he seeks him out as a powerful ally or a foe worth testing his skills against.",
      "Nerif is not involved in any of the events of Dragon's Blood. He makes a brief physical appearance at the very beginning of the first episode and continues to narrate the intro when he is offscreen. Here, he introduces the viewer to the origins of the Dota universe, the Chaos of the Infinite, the introduction of the Nemesis Stones, and Terrorblade's plan to remake creation.",
      "\"In the beginning, there was only the Primordial Mind. From this mind sprang the whole of creation. The stars, the planets, life and death. But in time, the Mind was divided against itself. Two fragments, the Radiant and the Dire, thought and action, warred over creation with irreconcilable ferocity. The Chaos of the Infinite followed.",
      "Kings, queens. Gods. Monsters. They all sought wisdom in the shattered Primordial Mind and power from its ineffable madness. But in his prison in Foulfell, the demon Terrorblade gazed into the chaos and found Truth. Terrorblade found the idea. Fuse thought and action. Remake creation in his own infernal image.\"",
      "In the Artifact timeline, the  Dark Seer has heard of this strange sayer, but has yet to meet him. Ish'Kafel heard of his claims that he had the ability to see every possibility, a gift that any practitioner of chance would covet. If this is true, then he must seek him out as a powerful ally, or at the very least a worthy foe worth testing his prediction skills against.",
      "Although he has seen his death in the hands of the  Phantom Assassin across an ocean of possibilities, he has managed to sway Mortred to his side with answers that she may need to know. Striking a deal with his former assassin, Nerif has bound her to a contract, giving her a pair of reality cutting blades to help her fulfill it. Who knows what Nerif might repay her with in exchange for killing his nemeses...",
      "All Oracles have the ability to see the future, and Nerif is no exception. To see the future, the soul of an Oracle must drift far beyond the material plane while still being bound to their physical form by their soul's tether, roaming far afield until they return. From there, the Oracle will report back with mystic utterances: \"words of fire\" spoken with \"tongues of flesh\". It appears that their mystic utterances are vague or something similar because they must be analyzed first in order to unlock the prophecies found in them.",
      "As for where their souls go to see the future, it can be speculated that they can see the future within the Astral Plane. According to Inai, the map of all time is found in the Astral Plane, which appears in the form of lines across the spiritual plane.",
      "Lorewise, Nerif is one of the most powerful Heroes in Dota 2's roster. Perhaps it would be wrong to call it a prophecy, because Nerif's words may actually come true in short notice. That is, if he wills it to be. When Nerif portends something, be it a detailed explanation or a vague sentence, it is bound to happen in reality. His prophecies destroyed the Ivory Incubarium just after he described a vision where it was crushed under an avalanche, and reality (on a local scale) endlessly split itself into an infinite multiverse when he just said \"It could go either way\" in response to the Graven King's demands.",
      "Fate and causality are quite intertwined, so it's only natural for Nerif to be able to manipulate the latter. Even his prophecies can break causality to create a paradox of a specific event where both outcomes can occur at the same time, even if it's impossible like being existent and nonexistent at the same time. When Nerif split causality during the invasion of the Satrapy, the participants' minds were also split so that they could experience both outcomes as they happened at the same time.",
      "Nerif's self-prophesied path has lead him into the sunken realms, and in the wake of his path, he has broken these deep sea civilizations. It is up to those who survived his presence to build their future from the remains of their destroyed home.",
      "Nerif's powers reflect his double-edged words: It could go either way. Each of his abilities can achieve two opposing outcomes, one that affects himself or his team, or one that affects his enemies. As the great foreseer would often say: \"The odds are with us. Or are they?\"",
      "The astral orb that floats in his hands is a catalyst for  Fortune's End. Channeling power into the orb, it shoots a bolt of raw energy that temporarily disrupts an enemy's connection to their own body. Basically, this power forces an astral projection on the opponent, which might be the reason why the enemy is stopped (in gameplay) since one cannot animate the body without a soul in it. The description for this ability also state that its energy is \"scouring\", which explains its ability to remove effects.",
      "Using his powers over fate, Nerif decrees an unbreakable  Fate's Edict on a chosen ally's destiny. The prophecy resounds: \"A chosen ally shall briefly suffer no magics. Other kinds of suffering however...\" Besides its absolute protection over magic, it would seem that this blessing comes at a price.",
      "Purifying Flames allows Nerif to incinerate a target in the flames of prophecy, before causing them to regenerate health if they managed to survive the initial effect. Among the many possibilities where Mortred confronts the sayer, one of them had Nerif kill his assassin with this ability without healing her afterwards.",
      "False Promise is what its name implies it is. Temporarily altering an ally's destiny, Nerif delays their fate as they undergo a state of indeterminacy, being oblivious but unaffected by any healing or harm until it wears off. The target's destiny is realized at the end of False Promise depending on what had happened to them during that state."

      "Harbinger, the Outworld Destroyer"
     ],
     "Intro": [
      "One of a lordly and magisterial race, Harbinger prowls the edge of the Void, sole surviving sentry of an outpost on the world at the rim of the abyss. From this jagged crystalline Outworld, forever on guard, he has gazed for eternities into the heavens, alert for any stirring in the bottomless night beyond the stars. Imprinted deep in the shining lattices of his intellect lies a resonant pattern akin to prophecy, a dark music implying that eventually some evil will wake out there, beyond the edges of creation, and turn its attention to our world. With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Destroyer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war. Harbinger's place in our own prophecies is unambiguous: he must be considered an omen of worse things to come. But his arrival in itself is bad enough."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "As an embodiment of an omen and as someone who has foreseen what it will bring, Harbinger frequently speaks of fate, prophecies, and the grim future that he has foreseen.\nWith that being said, he also claims to be indirectly responsible for his actions. Just like how a black cat, a common omen and catalyst for bad luck, is indirectly responsible for the ill fortune that a person crossing its path will receive.",
      "With that being said, he also claims to be indirectly responsible for his actions. Just like how a black cat, a common omen and catalyst for bad luck, is indirectly responsible for the ill fortune that a person crossing its path will receive.",
      "Harbinger's foresight, otherwordly intelligence, and expansive view on existence (as well as the bad things that will happen to it) has given him a very disconnected view of reality, at least to his perspective. Concepts like currency, the suffering of others, and the earthly wars fought for the Ancients are insignificant to him, unless Harbinger senses that there is something very concerning in them.\nWhen successfully destroying an Ancient, he will celebrate and say that his existence has meaning, implying that it didn't have any before. It is likely that his gloomy view on existence made him say this, since he knows that his existence has no meaning for eventually, everything is just going to come to an end.\nWhen meeting Harbinger,  Queen of Pain will point this out in a rival line for him.",
      "When successfully destroying an Ancient, he will celebrate and say that his existence has meaning, implying that it didn't have any before. It is likely that his gloomy view on existence made him say this, since he knows that his existence has no meaning for eventually, everything is just going to come to an end.",
      "When meeting Harbinger,  Queen of Pain will point this out in a rival line for him.",
      "Harbinger has no qualms about manipulating others for his own ends. He willingly joins the Dire as a servant, but secretly plans to control their leader for reasons unknown.",
      "It can be speculated that this ebb and flow may refer to the expenditure of mana and its eventual regeneration over time, respectively.",
      "The last sentence may be a reason why this ability can hit those affected by  Astral Imprisonment, since it banishes them to another dimension.",
      "An eerie visitant to our realm from the outer dark, Harbinger, the Outworld Destroyer (or Outworld Devourer) arrives to our world to bring dark tidings and unswayable omens that only he could hope to avert. He originates from the World on the Rim, a crystalline fortress afloat in the cold nameless space between the stars and planets. Although he is very powerful and intimidating on his own, he is merely an omen for worse things that await all of creation.",
      "Harbinger is the sole surviving member of an unnamed magisterial race, whose sole remaining member has sentenced himself to an eternal vigil on a vantage point known as the Outworld. On this crystalline fortress, Harbinger anticipates the evil that was foretold in the prophetic music of his mind, its rhythms implying that eventually this evil from the edges of reality will awaken and turn its attention to our world with an ineffable but certainly dark intention. Harbinger paid little attention to the events across the solar system containing the planet housing the warring Ancients, but a sense at the edge of his consciousness tells him that the war of the Ancients itself might serve as the catalyst of a darker force that may very well be the same evil that he has been anticipating for eternities.",
      "Although he once trivialized this war, a change of mind has dispatched him towards the mundane planet to end the conflict between both Ancients in the hopes that at least this evil may be averted for the time being. But his arrival is not to be heralded as a messianic presence, but rather an explicit omen with warnings and bad news awaiting those who need to hear it\u2014that is to say, all of existence.",
      "Deep in the cold space between the stars and the planets, Harbinger has anticipated Kanna's rise to power and the induction of the Earthshaker as her champion. What he does not sense, however, is her acceptance of an authority figure's guidance as she has disowned her mother. And so he goes, his stony wings aloft, towards the celestial body housing the warring Ancients.  He aligns with the hordes of the Dire and presents himself as Kanna's very own seneschal, filling up the void that her mother left behind. Little does she know that Harbinger has already set the cornerstone for her eternal servitude towards him. And nothing can prepare them for whatever he plans to do with her next...",
      "Harbinger is one of the few heroes of Dota 2 to have an unambiguous alignment with an Ancient and its armies. In the card game Artifact, he has allied himself with the forces of Dire, including the likes of Kanna and  Earthshaker who was recruited by the former.",
      "It is only natural for a Dire hero to be ill disposed towards the Radiant. Harbinger protects Kanna from her own mother, Prellex, who is a priestess of the Radiant. He also seeks to kill her while claiming that her daughter is right about something that she said.",
      "Harbinger's head and the upper surface of his body are coated in dark stones with veins that flow with green energy. The rest of his body appears to resemble that of a griffin's, with extremities that resemble the talons of eagle, save for the appearance of fingernails on his hands. The stone that covers his body might be the same material that can be found in his Outworld homeland, since a self-assembling crystal and a species of crystalline tree, both native to the Outworld, share a similar composition with his gritty body.",
      "The rocky material that covers his body serves as armor impregnable to the piercing rays of the evil forces from the outer dark. He may also wear an armor that's forged from the plasmic residue of a star named Dragon, which is said to be much more durable than dragon hide.",
      "His wings produce a strange sound whenever they beat. This may be the so-called rhythms of eternity that he refers to.",
      "As an eldritch being, Harbinger's powers are based on his superior intelligence and mastery of the arcane energies. He is also one of the few heroes who have the ability to foresee the future, but he doesn't rely on scrying or foresight. Instead, he relies on the dark music in his mind that, according to his biography, plays a resonant pattern akin to a prophecy.",
      "Harbinger's outworldly knowledge allows itself to access the ebb and flow of all spiritual energy, infusing it into his being to project a powerful  Arcane Orb. This so-called ebb and flow of spiritual energy may be a synonym for mana, as it is often described as a spiritual or ethereal energy.",
      "Astral Imprisonment is an ability where Harbinger banishes an unfortunate victim into the pocket between \"this world\" (presumably the material plane) and the Outworld, where they realize their infantile knowledge and vulnerability to death. Some of Harbinger's unused voice lines imply that this pocket is named \"the Outer Dark\" or \"the Abyss\", likely referring to the same Void mentioned in his biography and in his signature card in Artifact.",
      "Essence Flux allows him to replenish his energy reserves by channeling the the arcane energy produced by the Outworld's crystals through any of his rifts, causing it to flow into his being regardless of his location. This essentially makes him a living mana dispenser, except that the energy he dispenses is reserved for him alone.",
      "Lastly, when Harbinger ruptures an Outworld crystal, it unleashes a  Sanity's Eclipse that releases powerful energies to blot out the minds of those caught in the blast. Such is its power that its reverberations can be felt across dimensions.",
      "Outside of his gameplay abilities, Harbinger has some powers in his lore. If necessary, Harbinger may call upon a dark power to protect the \"inmost shells of creation\" from the evil incomprehensible forces bent on destroying it. Besides being described as symmetrical, nothing else is said about this power. He also possesses a staff made of self-assembling crystals from Outworld that can imprison opponents inside them."

      "The men and women that make up the Nivan Gallants live a life of swordplay, chandelier swinging, and tawdry romance. And while all adhere to their creed that \"A life of adventure is the only life worth living,\" the exploits of Dont\u00e9 Panlin still manage to raise the eyebrows of even the most hedonistic of swordsmen.There is no monster he won\u2019t slay. No creature he won\u2019t woo. No tyrant he won\u2019t stand against. And no noble immune to his silver tongue."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Dont\u00e9 Panlin is a swashbuckling, fun-loving rogue who relishes danger and adventure. A member of the Nivan Gallants, he roams the world in search of righteous challenges, fighting tyrants, slaying monsters, while chiding nobles with his sharp wit. Bound by a sense of honor, Donte avoids cruelty, unfair fights and picking on the young and disabled. With humor and charm, Donte projects a stylish flamboyance, and admires others who do the same. He has fought and won many a battle, and gained himself a following of fans. Like those of his order, Donte is fond of wine and easy romance, and possesses a strong sense of loyalty and camaraderie with his brothers. Vanity is no small part of Donte's personality, and he regularly examines his appearance in the mirror. He is right-handed.",
      "Donte Panlin was born to a noble family. Like the others of his race, he is covered in scales, which were soft when he was young, and hardened over time. His scales are desired as a valuable material, possibly for making armor.",
      "In his youth, Donte joined the Nivan Gallants, an order of hedonistic swordsmen devoted to adventure and fighting injustice. He was mentored by Etienne Swiftguard. As the Gallants battled King Sylak's pyromancers, Etienne was fatally wounded, and with the last of his energy, he gave Donte his musket. Having become a full-fledged member of the Gallants, Donte lives by honor and anti-authority, shunning the biddings of kings and preferring the company of commoners.",
      "As expected of his order, Donte carries himself with chivalrous honor, forsaking needless cruelty whenever possible, and stands against oppression and slavery. He regards his fellow Gallants as brothers and sisters, and feel an duty-bound obligation to them. At the same time, he shares a sense of friendly competition with his brothers, trying to outdo one another's feats.",
      "In his adventures, Donte has fought tyrants and killed many demons. He once sought to kill the mage Vorn, but Azwraith killed him before he got the chance. Although he has no real interest in the conflict between the Ancients, he joined the battle nonetheless out of a desire for glory and adventure.",
      "Donte's journeys take him to all parts of the world. He has been as far as Revtel and Qaldin, seen the arts of the Marrowfell Hunters, and once rolled into a pit of basilisks. He accepts new quests, promising to help Medusa find her kidnapped sisters.",
      "Because of his brash ways, Donte has been named a criminal by many authorities, although he has never been caught. Nevertheless, he feels that unjust laws were meant to be broken, and that his actions were justified. Gondar, working for a mysterious figure called the Brass Herald, has been sent out to hunt him down.",
      "When he's not fighting, Donte appears to have an appreciation for fine cuisine. With his keen sense of smell, he can distinguish the spices of distant lands. He also has a taste for fine wines, particularly the White Wine of Icewrack. In his spare time, he also frequents the race tracks at White Spire.",
      "Donte is a womanizer, and has had relationships with dangerous women before. He flirts openly with every female hero he meets, and goes as far as to ask Razzil to make him a love potion.",
      "Donte has known Mireska since her early days in Revtel, and remains concerned about her. Seeing her abandon her home for a life of theft and crime, he tries to talk her into taking a different path, and warns her that she is becoming just like her father, whom she hates. When he hears that Gondar has been sent to capture Mireska, he tells him not to harm her and jeopardize her future. Despite this, Mireska hates being lectured, and despises him for it.",
      "Finding allies among other righteous figures, Donte has worked with the likes of Aiushtha and Ursa in the past. He has a gentle and diplomatic side, oftening acting as a middleman between two quarreling parties. For example, he advises Yurnero to apologize to Lanaya, his jilted lover, and persuades Lina to reconcile her differences with Rylai, her younger sister.",
      "He has fought numerous challenges, including Sorla Khan of the Red Mist and Sun Wukong, whom he pierced with his rapier by throwing it at him while he was transformed as a tree. Rigwarl is one of Donte's most despised rivals, and he once sliced off his quills in the heat of battle, causing Rigwarl to flee.",
      "But not all of his rivalries boil down to simple brawls. Donte has a strong dislike for the evil and demonic, and vows to put down enemies like Rotund'jere for his role in causing mass suffering. Even so, Donte appears merciful and willing to give second chances. He has run into Lion before, and warned him that if they should ever meet again, there would be consequences.",
      "Leshrac has a very personal history with Donte, and although details are unclear, he is one of his most hated foes. Long ago, Leshrac did something to a woman in Donte's life, and Donte has not forgiven him since. At the time, Donte let Leshrac live, but made an oath to kill him in revenge the next time he saw him.",
      "Donte appears to have inadvertently insulted Disruptor when he lumped him in with the more violent Oglodi of the Red Mist, and is remorseful about it."

      "Through a process of divination, children are selected for upbringing by the Sisters of the Veil, an order that considers assassination a sacred part of the natural order. The Veiled Sisters identify targets through meditation and oracular utterances. They accept no contracts, and never seem to pursue targets for political or mercenary reasons. Their killings bear no relation to any recognizable agenda, and can seem to be completely random: A figure of great power is no more likely to be eliminated than a peasant or a well digger. Whatever pattern the killings may contain, it is known only to them. They treat their victims as sacrifices, and death at their hand is considered an honor. Raised with no identity except that of their order, any Phantom Assassin can take the place of any other; their number is not known. Perhaps there are many, perhaps there are few. Nothing is known of what lies under the Phantom Veil. Except that this one, from time to time, when none are near enough to hear, is known to stir her veils with the forbidden whisper of her own name: Mortred."

Yet war came for them nonetheless. Joining the able-bodied conscripts as they filed passed their homes, the humble lancer Azwraith vowed to bring peace to his kingdom, and in so doing, his people. Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep.Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished. The pikeman who had stood before them was no more than another phantom."

From this inferno raced new beacons, star progeny identical to its parent, who journeyed an unlit ocean and settled in constellatory array. In time, they too would be made to propagate through supernova flame. So would this dazzling cycle of birth and rebirth repeat until all skies hewn of Titan toil deigned to twinkle and shine.By this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find itself in need of more influence than a dying sun's distant rays could provide. Thus this infant son of suns took terrestrial form, eagerly travelling to shine its warmth upon those who may need it most, and perhaps seize upon its solar destiny."

      "In the Fields of Endless Carnage, far to the south of Quoidge, a corpulent figure works tirelessly through the night--dismembering, disembowelling, piling up the limbs and viscera of the fallen that the battlefield might be clear by dawn. In this cursed realm, nothing can decay or decompose; no corpse may ever return to the earth from which it sprang, no matter how deep you dig the grave. Flocked by carrion birds who need him to cut their meals into beak-sized chunks, Pudge the Butcher hones his skills with blades that grow sharper the longer he uses them. Swish, swish, thunk. Flesh falls from the bone; tendons and ligaments part like wet paper. And while he always had a taste for the butchery, over the ages, Pudge has developed a taste for its byproduct as well. Starting with a gobbet of muscle here, a sip of blood there...before long he was thrusting his jaws deep into the toughest of torsos, like a dog gnawing at rags. Even those who are beyond fearing the Reaper, fear the Butcher."

      "Pudge enjoys working with Atropos.",
      "Pudge once said something about Riki, possibly while he was invisible, and is now embarrassed about it.",
      "Pudge once ate one of Vrogros' followers.",
      "Pudge has an antagonistic relationship with the Dead God, on account of him stealing the Chains of Abscession.",
      "The Flayed Twins admire Pudge's grisly butchery.",
      "Although he is often asked, Pudge refuses to answer any questions about his family, and gets quite irate at curious strangers. In his youth, he served in the employ of King Brandalon as his royal butcher. This was the beginning of Pudge's career, which he considered the best years of his life. The King's reign was particularly bloody, and Pudge is one of the few who are still alive to remember the carnage. At some point, he also spent some time on a farm.",
      "Pudge is immune to most forms of natural decay. This trait was sought by an enchanter from Weeping Rose who managed to acquire it (in the form of Pudge's essence) through unknown means. This essence was later used to bring the inanimate Pudge doll to life.",
      "Seeking meat, Pudge journeyed to the Fields of Endless Carnage, where he loomed over the dead, cutting up and devouring their flesh. For reasons unknown, he left the Fields before the Rumusque Clerics made a pilgrimage there to purge the land.",
      "Pudge is a voracious eater of meat. He prefers raw, red meat, but will consume just about any type of flesh, including that of his fallen enemies. He is so gluttonous that he once ate a black dragon. He follows where war goes, keeping his belly filled with the fresh meat of the newly slain.",
      "Occasionally, Pudge also eats a bit of raw fish, although he does not consider it \"real\" meat. He is also fond of bone marrow, but doesn't care much for chicken.",
      "He has a keen sense of smell, especially for meat. Unlike most living things, Pudge never needs to sleep.",
      "Long ago, the Chains of Abscession were forged by the Rumusque cleric Crella to bind the minions of the Dead God. Over time, the Chains became corrupted by The Dirge, and fell into the Dead God's power. They turned against Crella's people, destroying her homeland. Since then, the Chains have taken on a mind of their own. It dislikes gods, and has a particular hunger for Anti-Mage, likely due to his opposition to the Dead God. The Chains are familiar with Vrogros, having consumed his minions before.",
      "Pudge came upon the Chains of Abscession after being banished for an unknown reason. He found himself in a place filled with the dead, and smelled something of interest inside a great crack in the earth. Entering the crack, Pudge encountered the Chains of Abscession, lured there by the same things he had smelled. The Chains moved of their own accord, flying through the air and attacking Pudge. Eventually, he was able to subdue the Chains, and bring it under his control. The Dead God considers this an act of theft, and demands the Chains be returned, going as far as to send Pudge meat. However, Pudge enjoys the Chains' company and has no intention of giving them back.",
      "Deep in an estate in the kingdom of Krimwohl, a young girl born to royalty lived alone by herself: she had no parental figures, guardians, or servants around to attend to her needs. Over time, she developed a wicked personality and heard of the tales of Pudge, a monster immune to all decay. Using the vast wealth and connections at her disposal, she called upon an enchanter from Weeping Rose to retrieve the essence of Pudge. The enchanter's journey took months to complete, and in that timeframe the Pudge doll was crafted as a vessel for the essence.",
      "The enchanter finally arrived at Krimwohl with Pudge's essence at hand, and the doll was ready to be imbued with it. Arcane markings were derived from the essence, which brought the The Toy Butcher to life. Little did they know that Pudge's immortality and imperishability wasn't the only trait that the doll inherited, but it also shared his voracious appetite as well as his memories, which made it believe that it was undead who lived in Quoidge (just like Pudge himself).",
      "Pudge once had a ditch hog as a pet. He found the animal in a pile of slaughtered meat, and had to sew back some of its wounds. It was his best friend, but he ate it in the end."

      "In the realm of Pugna's birth, near the vents of the Nether Reaches, there stood a lamasery devoted to the Arts of Oblivion, which drew its power from the nether energies. The Grandmaster of the temple compound had himself passed into Oblivion several years prior, leaving his academy without a leader. From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children.Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Although he is way past his younger years, Pugna still retains some of his childish demeanors. He is prone to tantrums, mischievous, and selfish.",
      "Pugna is a sadistic person. He even taught his brand of sadism to his pet Viper.",
      "Pugna is fond of domination and control. His brand of nihilism contradicts this however, making him a hypocrite.\nHe manifested this behavior at a young age back when he was enrolled in his academy, dominating his fellow classmates by preventing them from casting their magics in the presence of his wards and punishing them for not obeying him.",
      "He manifested this behavior at a young age back when he was enrolled in his academy, dominating his fellow classmates by preventing them from casting their magics in the presence of his wards and punishing them for not obeying him.",
      "Pugna is a nihilist. Not the stereotypical nihilist that believes nothing really matters, but Pugna is a nihilist who rejects moral principles. He puts his views into practice by aiming to destroy the Tyler Estate and the Quorum, both of which have established principles and boundaries to the usage of both good and bad magic. It would seem that there is no forbidden magic in their view, but they still seek to control the use of magic in general, which Pugna doesn't take kindly to.",
      "In Artifact, Viper succumbed to ennui when he escaped from Pugna, not being content with his freedom. Pugna was still unpunished, and so he flew back to reciprocate the suffering that he received from him. He soon came to a realization that Pugna was part of a bigger problem\u2014there were many magicians just like him who enslave and control familiars. Having reached a vile conclusion, Viper soared out with a new mission to enslave not only Pugna, but all other practitioners of magecraft.",
      "In the same continuity, it seems that Pugna has a non-sexual D/s relationship with Viper.",
      "Pugna also has the Draining Wight as one of his Nether Wards. This ward exists on the boundary between the corporeal realm and an unnamed spiritual plane of existence, which might be the Nether Reaches where it draws its power from. Because of this, it exists on two planes at once, causing it to be half-corporeal and half-ethereal, part bone and part spirit. The ward can drain the lifeforce of its victims, much like its master.",
      "Card art of this ability in Artifact Foundry depicts this ability stealing the soul of its victim as well, channeling it into the gem at the base of his collar.",
      "Hailing from the Nether Reaches, Pugna is the latest descendant in a lineage of reincarnated beings who are the superior practitioners of the Arts of Oblivion. Chosen at a tender age by the regents of the late Grandmaster of Oblivion to determine their master's next reincarnation, he wasted no time and effort in displaying his innate ability to wield the power of Oblivion and the Nether Realm, qualifying him to the throne of his predecessor.",
      "Having grown more powerful than his previous incarnation as he learned more dark magics in his academy and grew older, he now wields the emerald flames of the Nether Reaches and the power of Oblivion with indiscriminate effect: incinerating anyone he wishes, toppling their creations into ashes, and stealing whatever he wants from whoever he deigns to notice.",
      "Born in the Nether Reaches, Pugna was only thirteen months old when he was selected among two other ankle biters by the regents of the late Grandmaster of Oblivion. Years before little Pugna's rite of passage, the Grandmaster had passed into Oblivion, leaving his temple for the Arts of Oblivion without a leader. From the moment of his passing, his regents immediately began rites of divination to identify their master's next reincarnation, and eventually all omens converged on the children of the village before their master's temple.",
      "On the appointed day, the infantile Pugna (alongside two other promising tots) was brought to the late grandmaster's temple to verify the prophecies of their master's reincarnation. The lamas presented a hodgepodge of the grandmaster's worn belongings before them to see if any of them could recognize the relics from a previous life. One little boy picked up a porphyry wand that belonged to the head lama and put it in his nostril. An impish girl took an amulet that also belonged to the lama and immediately swallowed it. But Pugna came along and regarded them coolly, letting out a merry laugh, before incinerating them both in puffs of Nether Fire. He then snatched the items (that were somehow not burned) from their remains and exclaimed \"Mine!\"",
      "With their master's reincarnation identified, the lamas hoisted the smiling Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their former master's regalia, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end.",
      "As an elderly being, Pugna captured a malevolent netherdrake named Viper from the luminous caverns of the Nether Reaches where the toxic drakes thrived for millions of years. The sadistic wizard hoped to tame this beast, casting enchainments and dark sorceries to make it submit to him. Unbeknownst to him was the netherdrake's intentional submission to his magic and bondage\u2014the netherdrake had hoped to learn his master's practices. During Viper's enslavement, Pugna was also practicing the art of magical augmentation, which Viper observed with great interest.",
      "Viper would soon learn that some of his master's sorceries were deadly for him to endure, and so he sought immediate escape. Exuding an acid that melted the bars of his cage, he set himself free and spat poison in Pugna's eyes before escaping his prison. As for Pugna, it would seem that he has survived being poisoned by the most toxic creature alive, which may be the reason why he became a skeleton. Alongside his other nefarious goals, he now seeks to reclaim his lost pet Viper.",
      "Pugna had no interest in the battle between the Red Mist and Stonehall, neither did he have any significant influence on it. Instead, he sets himself against the Tyler Estate and the Quorum as a one mage army against the forces that seek to control magic, before finally setting his sights on Weeping Rose when they both have been burned to ash.",
      "Pugna acts as a proxy for Ix'yxa the Destroyer in finding new paths to the surface world for Ix'yxa to traverse. As a proxy, he wears a headpiece that holds the eye of Ix'yxa which carefully watches over him to make sure that he holds up his end of the deal.",
      "In Artifact, Pugna has sworn allegiance to the Dire and its leader Kanna. Some of his responses towards her indicate that he wishes to replace her as the new leader of the Dire.",
      "A Hero of the Dire is naturally aligned against the Radiant. He symphatizes with Kanna, who hates her mother Prellex.",
      "The elderly Pugna took  Viper as a pet and as a test subject for deadly spells that he was working with. Viper poisoned his master and broke out of his bonds, swearing vengeance and enslavement on all who were like him. It would seem that Pugna survived the encounter (likely the reason why he now looks undead) and wishes to reclaim his pet.",
      "As a part of a legacy of reincarnated masters of Oblivion, Pugna is well-trained in the Arts of Oblivion. He is also knowledgeable on the arts of magical augmentation.",
      "All of Pugna's powers are applications of the Arts of Oblivion. Some of his powers were learned in the academy for the Arts of Oblivion, and some were his birthright as a reincarnation of his predecessor.",
      "Nether Blast allows Pugna to summon a powerful blast of the Nether Reaches' emerald fire, reducing beings and structures alike into piles of ashes. Even as a baby, Pugna was able to use this (without any magic appurtenances) in the form of fire-gouts, which only grew stronger as he aged. It can be cast inside the target to destroy them from within.",
      "Decrepify is a spell that Pugna has mastered in his childhood at the academy for the Arts of Oblivion. This spell will banish its target to the Nether Realm, causing them to become ethereal because of the implied spiritual existence of the place. Their ethereal status renders them unable to influence or be influenced by matters material, but it leaves them just as vulnerable as they were against magical or spiritual attacks.",
      "Arguably one of his most annoying abilities, his  Nether Ward acts as a turret that automatically shoots blasts of Nether magic at nearby casters that dares to spend mana or other magic resources for casting spells in its presence.",
      "Testimony to his greater power over his predecessors,  Life Drain allows Pugna to steal the lifeforce of others, channeling their essence into his being. Despite its power, it is implied to have a cooldown, which is removed by the power of  Aghanim's Scepter."

      "Any mage can cast a spell or two, and a few may even study long enough to become a wizard, but only the most talented are allowed to be recognized as a Magus. Yet as with any sorcerer's circle, a sense of community has never guaranteed competitive courtesy.Already a renowned duelist and scholar of the grander world of sorcery, it had never occurred to Rubick that he might perhaps be Magus material until he was in the midst of his seventh assassination attempt. As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition. Therefore, donning his combat mask, he did what any wizard seeking to ascend the ranks would do: he announced his intention to kill a Magus.Rubick quickly discovered that to threaten one Magus is to threaten them all, and they fell upon him in force. Each antagonist's spell was an unstoppable torrent of energy, and every attack a calculated killing blow. But very soon something occurred that Rubick's foes found unexpected: their arts appeared to turn against them. Inside the magic maelstrom, Rubick chuckled, subtly reading and replicating the powers of one in order to cast it against another, sowing chaos among those who had allied against him. Accusations of betrayal began to fly, and soon the sorcerers turned one upon another without suspecting who was behind their undoing.When the battle finally drew to a close, all were singed and frozen, soaked and cut and pierced. More than one lay dead by an ally's craft. Rubick stood apart, sore but delighted in the week's festivities. None had the strength to argue when he presented his petition of assumption to the Hidden Council, and the Insubstantial Eleven agreed as one to grant him the title of Grand Magus."

      "At some point in time, Rubick captured a mysterious puzzle named the Puzzle of Perplex in a special staff. He has spent his idle moments attempting to unlock this mysterious puzzle, but he could not solve it by himself. From time to time, he casts this puzzle on an enemy in hopes of gaining insight from their futile attempts to solve it as they hang enthralled by its mesmerizing mechanisms.",
      "When Rubick discovered the crux of this puzzle, he found a \"surprisingly simple\" trick that would allow him to manipulate four-dimensional space to affect reality around him. But even after he did that, he realized that the knowledge at the heart of this puzzle would also allow him to alter the very foundations of magic itself. No longer reliant on the spellcasting of others, he now toys with the boundaries of arcane artistry, reshaping and revealing the unexplored world of magic to his liking.",
      "Rubick is the son of Aghanim, the owner of the legendary  Aghanim's Scepter. He struggles to live up to his father's fame, living in the shadow cast by his accomplishments in the world of magic and has so far been unable to do so.",

      "Among the sovereign demons with explicit access to this world, Doom scarcely bothers with the affairs of Noninfernals and Lesser Spectral Consorts, while Shadow Fiend passes through almost exclusively on collecting expeditions. The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities.Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will.What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens\u2014and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup.Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers."

His strange new youngling, part hill troll, part\u2026something else, worked as assistant and lent an air of the exotic to the con-man's trade.Always one step ahead of cheated customers, one town ahead of a pursuing patronage, the two trekked across the blighted lands until one day the con-man realized that the little youngling could actually do what he only pretended at. His ward had a gift\u2014a gift that customers valued. And so the youngling Rhasta was thrust before the crowds, and the trade-name Shadow Shaman was born. The two continued from town to town, conjuring for money as Shadow Shaman's reputation grew. Eventually, the pair's duplicitous past caught up with them, and they were ambushed by a mob of swindled ex-clients.

Magicians like Rhasta were blamed for diseases and poor harvests, leading to their persecution and execution. Fearing for his life, Rhasta hid his shamanic powers, disguising himself as a vagabond, while performing the same services the old con-man once had. Should anyone ask about his skills, he claimed he had merely learned them on the road as a wanderer. His master's advice stayed with him, and he wore a wide-brimmed hat, as well as banners on his back that clearly displayed the services he offered, in case of any confusion that may lead to hostilities with distrustful villagers. While on the road, he brewed a potent drink, which he kept in a bottle by his side, toxic to everyone except himself.",
      "Rhasta's enemies piled up as he killed his pursuers, attracting even more powerful foes to seek him out. To avoid this, he went into hiding below the earth, but did not find sanctuary there either. Instead, he was met by Gliss, a lordly serpent priest who desired his powers, and tried to attack him with a cursed decanter. Rhasta had no choice but to kill Gliss, and later acquired the priest's censer for himself."

     "Intro": [
      "Part of the seventh and final generation of a carefully designed pedigree, Nortrom was bred by the ancient order of the Aeol Drias to be the greatest magic user the world had ever seen. He was the prophesied one, the culmination of two-hundred years of careful pairings, a war-mage who would bring glory to the order, and destruction to their sworn enemies, The Knights of the Fold.Raised with other young mages in a hidden cantonment among the hills of the Hazhadal Barrens, the order's preceptors waited for Nortrom's abilities to manifest. While the other students honed their talents with fire, or ice, or incantatory spells, Nortrom sat silent and talentless, unable to cast so much as a hex. As the day of final testing approached, he still hadn't found his magic. In disgust, the preceptors berated him, while the children laughed. \"You are no mage,\" the head of the order declared. Still, Nortrom did not slink away. He entered the day of testing and faced down the young mages who had mocked him. And then his preceptors learned a valuable lesson: a lack of magic can be the greatest magic of all. Nortrom silenced the young mages one by one and defeated them in single combat, until he alone stood as champion of the Aeol Drias, in fulfillment of the prophecy."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "According to his own biography, Nortrom might be an inbred person or produced by inbreeding.",
      "After defeating the young mages on the day of his final test, Nortrom applied his newfound skills in \"suppressing\" the godless outlaws of the Hazhadal Barrens, where made short work of their animal enthrallers.",
      "In the earliest days of his childhood, Nortrom's caretakers spoke fervently about the prophecy that he will soon fulfill, and the blessed favors that they will all receive on the day of Nortrom's ascension for raising the prophesied war mage. The same caretakers would soon feel spite and neglect for him when his lack of magic began to show, not knowing that his true abilities have yet to be manifested.",
      "Nortrom wields various equipment that wield the power of silence, including a shield that deflects magic soundlessly, another shield that emanates a calm and still aura that silences nearby enemies, and a glaive forged in the heart of a dead star in a soundless corner of the universe.",
      "He also wields a glaive and a shield related to Oscilla. He was the first to posit that these are no mere items of power, but astral appendages of a great creature which can be used to find its other pieces.",
      "Nortrom is the warden of the Tyler Estate, working alongside the Anti-Mage with the common goal of policing the usage of magic. He is pleased to work with the Anti-Mage, likely due to their similar anti-magic abilities. Despite this, they have different methods in dealing with sorcerers: Nortrom prefers them to be imprisoned then drained of their magical capabilities, while Anti-Mage would rather kill them instead."

He lives only to extend his reach, for as long as he is perpetually building and adding to his domain he cannot die. The walls of his palace are formed of fired bone; the streets are paved with bones of every sort of creature and every enemy; and even the wood and other natural features of his land have been swept away and replaced with replicas formed of bone. From the Ivory Forest to Ostarion's towering Throne of Bone, nothing happens in the Empire of Bones without the full knowledge of its Skeleton King."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Ostarion is a cruel king.",
      "Ostarion is into BDSM.",
      "He would soon lose this ability upon his transformation as the Wraith King, replacing his hellfire with wraith flame that now draws its power from his damned lineage.",
      "However, his second incarnation regained this ability after one particular resurrection process. On his return passage through the veil of death, the ghost king was attacked by a swirling flame that struggled to drive him back into the endless abyss. Using his mailed fist, he thrashed and tore against the ethereal fire until he returned to the earthly realm.\nThis flame may be his \"hellish lineage\" that he discarded upon becoming a wraith and his lineage is probably seeking vengeance for abandoning them.",
      "This flame may be his \"hellish lineage\" that he discarded upon becoming a wraith and his lineage is probably seeking vengeance for abandoning them.",
      "According to  Alchemist, Skeleton King's body contains calcium nitrate.",
      "Ostarion is the Skeleton King, an immortal being unfettered from the frailties of mortal flesh. Both a king and a collector, he rules over a vast kingdom purely made of bone that is the source of his immortality (or so he thought) and he constantly expands this bony land from the remains of his enemies.",
      "Not content to rule with political power, Ostarion has absolute control over every aspect of his kingdom, and nothing can move in his Empire of Bone without his permission.",
      "Once a mortal royal, the young prince Ostarion was swiftly brought to the throne when his royal family succumbed to a swift rotting disease. The disease nearly claimed him as well, until their desperate court mage Azorszos cast an ossification ritual on him, scouring the prince's flesh and turning him into a being of animated bone. Having almost experienced death for himself and defied it once, he swore to never submit to death ever again.",
      "Ostarion's ossification was a life changing experience for him. He gained a deep mistrust for all things fleshy and an obsession for bone, which he believed was imperishable unlike flesh. Like what his court mage did to him, he began to recast his family's empire into an immortal land of bone. Each stone of his kingdom was painstakingly replaced with its equivalent in bone; the roads have been paved with bone; the walls of his palace are lined with fired bone, and even the natural aspects of the land such as the trees have been felled and replaced with replicas of bone.",
      "Not content with the lands currently in his domain, and with the belief that he could not die as long as he kept building his kingdom in bone, he set his sights on the neighboring lands and the bones of their inhabitants to satisfy his thirst for life. His armies conquered the adjacent kingdoms, extending the reach of his eternal realm, while he extracted the bones of his enemies. Soon, his kingdom became a cold, immaculate white land made of nothing but bone that could not move unless he willed it.",
      "Ostarion's campaigns as the Skeleton King have been retconned and transferred to his next incarnation Wraith King. This includes his attack against the Dreadknight, and his conquest on a small kingdom known for its textile specialists.",
      "Untold years have passed as they accumulated into centuries and Ostarion's domain kept growing larger. Although he was more than content with his immortal body of bone, his skeletal form began to deteriorate after too many resurrections, and he would soon learn that even bone could perish. Word has reached him that there was an essence that was truly more imperishable than anything from the mortal plane and it can be harvested during the longest night of the year\u2014a long night before the eve of Frostivus. Determined to preserve himself for eternity, he staked his hopes on this essence and sought out the advice of his court mage.",
      "Ostarion violently consulted Azorszos the Bony about this solstice and how he could acquire the essence released by it. Threatening him with another lifetime to spend in his current tormenting form, Azorszos pointed him to the books that contained the procedure required for a successful harvest during Wraith-Night. Satisfied, he promised his court mage that if the ritual goes well, he will finally fulfill the promise of death to end his suffering. He gathered his many knights to harvest the Wraith Essence from the ambulatory spirits, the influx of undead, and the possessed wildlife of Wraith-Night while he submitted to a magical trance cast by his mage-physician Azorszos that would last for the entirety of the harvest's duration.",
      "The hordes of ghosts, undead, and possessed creatures closed in on the tower where Ostarion slept on his altar while his all too loyal knights slaughtered them all, releasing sparks of Wraith Essence that flowed to the king. The warriors, oblivious to their expendability, fought through the longest night of the year until they perished and their Wraith-Essence was surrendered to him as his due tribute. At the end of the solstice, Ostarion awoke from his slumber as the sole survivor of the event and saw the sun shining on his face, his skeletal form transformed into a body of Wraith Flesh. A terrifying being reborn on the first day of Frostivus, which should have been a festival of peace and selfless charity.",
      "What ill fortune could this defilement of festivities possibly portend...",
      "Even in undeath, Ostarion retains his daddy issues. His father believed that he would never grow up to become something useful.",
      "While not exactly a benevolent king, Ostarion has a degree of concern for his subjects. On the other hand, he is fond of killing his own subjects on a whim. He kills his advisors, his blacksmiths, and peasants. He once had need for demonologists and others who dabble with demons, but no longer. It's implied that his court also has healers.",
      "Among the members of his royal court, only a few are mentioned. The most notable member is his mage-physician Azorszos the Bony, who has been serving Ostarion's lineage for at least nine centuries, long before his king was transformed into a skeletal being. During his time as Ostarion's Mage-Physik (another title for mage-physician) he remained in a tormenting form where his bare nerves were wrapped around his bones like vines. He was the one who revealed to him details about the Wraith-Night ritual and played a part in it by sentencing his king into a trance for the duration of the ritual. Azorszos looked forward to this ritual since he was willing to end his own suffering by any means necessary, and got his wish when he was finally sacrificed during the Wraith-Night ritual.",
      "Azorszos secretly regards his king as an ungrateful wretch.",
      "Long ago, Ostarion hired  Slark (whom he considered expendable) for a \"simple job\", but the latter failed and was imprisoned in Dark Reef. The exact details of this job are unknown, but judging by Slark's recent lore which was released in the same battle pass as Ostarion's arcana, it could possibly be his mission to steal the \"Dead God's Eye\" from an exiled member of the Rumusque.",
      "Ostarion and Barathrum's Master brokered a deal sealed by a contract between them. According to Ostarion, the latter didn't hold up his end of the bargain, and the contract is now null and void. When he meets  Spirit Breaker, he tells him to deliver a message to his master that says their contract is void.",
      "Ostarion is into  Queen of Pain and the torments she can bring. On the other hand, Akasha refuses his advances towards her.",
      "Ostarion doesn't like the Keen. He believes they are intolerable and better off dead. He hates dragons and Faerie Dragons, but he hates the latter even more. He hates demons with ambiguous goals, such as  Terrorblade.",
      "Ostarion had a sundial at one point, which was stolen by  Templar Assassin who was dispatched by  Void Spirit. They have broken his sundial, which made him angry.",
      "Ostarion got his first taste of immortality when he was ossified in his princehood by Azorszos. The mage-physician cast an ossification ritual to spare him from the swift rotting disease that killed his family and nearly claimed the young prince's life. Naturally, scouring every fleshy part of the body would kill any mortal, but this is a magical ritual. The ritual turned Ostarion into a being of animated bone, unfettered from the needs of flesh and its frailties such as decay and disease. Petrification magic is less effective on him as a result, likely because bones survive the process better than organic material and still remain as fossils even after that. He seems to be resistant to  Viper's poison and acid.",
      "His true immortality doesn't come from the fact that he is made of bone. It comes from his regenerative and resurrection capabilities. And these two are sustained so as long as he keeps building his Empire of Bone. It's unknown how the Empire of Bone sustains him, but it is possible that his kingdom is actually a reservoir for bone marrow (since it's composed of the bones of other fleshy creatures) that he draws upon to heal himself.",
      "It's interesting to note that Skeleton King's reincarnation only extends to his physical form, unlike Wraith King whose spiritual reincarnation can return him from the veil of death and the afterlife beyond it. He may be able to mend and regroup his bones after being shattered, but too many resurrections over the course of at least nine centuries can have a toll on his body, causing it to slowly deteriorate into dust. This is what made him seek an essence much more powerful and pure than bone itself.",
      "Ostarion calls upon his hellish lineage to fire a  Hellfire Blast from his fist to incinerate his opponents into ashes save for their precious bones.",
      "Vampiric Aura allows Skeleton King to drain the bone marrow of his opponent with each strike he successfully lands, nourishing him during battle. Its active component is a good demonstration of Ostarion's skill in necromancy, allowing him to summon his skeletal subjects to his side. His dark magic ensures that their loyalty to him will be eternal, even after they have died.",
      "The passive ability of  Mortal Strike doesn't have any lore to it.",
      "His  Reincarnation is best explained in the second and third paragraph of his Immortality section."

Sworn by birth to protect whoever sits within the Nest of Thorns, he hates the current Skywrath queen with all his soul. As a youth, high-born, he was a friend and companion to the eldest Skywrath princess, Shendelzare, first in line for the Nest. He had loved her warmly and unshakably, but as his studies took hold, his mind turned to arcane learning and the mastery of Skywrath sorcery.Obsessed with matters aetherial, he missed the mundane signs of courtly treachery that hinted at a plot against Shendelzare, and lost his chance to foil it. When the court was shaken by a swift and violent coup, he emerged from his studies to discover his oldest and dearest friend had been lost to him. The Nest of Thorns now belonged to Shendelzare's ruthless younger sister, and Dragonus could do nothing. The magic of the Skywrath Mage serves only the sworn protector of the Skywrath scion, so to act against the Nest would render him helpless. He clings to his post, believing it to be the best hope of one day restoring his true love to her rightful place. Meanwhile, his secret is known only to the goddess Scree'auk, whose magic it was transformed Shendelzare from a crippled physical creature into an embodiment of pure vengeful energy.While he dreams of restoring his beloved queen to the Ghastly Eyrie, he dreams even more desperately of restoring Shendelzare herself to a fully healed physical form. The duplicity of his role at court tortures him, for he is a noble and good-hearted creature; but the worst torture of all is imagining the hatred that Vengeful Spirit must hold in her heart for him."

      "Little known to the inhabitants of the dry world, Dark Reef is a sunken prison where the worst of the sea-breed are sent for crimes against their fellows. It is a razor barbed warren full of murderous slithereen, treacherous Deep Ones, and sociopathic meranths. In this dim labyrinth, patrolled by eels and guarded by enormous anemones, only the vicious survive. Pitched into Dark Reef for crimes unknown, Slark spent half a lifetime without kin or kindness, trusting no one, surviving through a combination of stealth and ruthlessness, keeping his thoughts and his plans to himself. When the infamous Dark Reef Dozen plotted their ill-fated breakout, they kept their plans a perfect secret, murdering anyone who could have put the pieces together--but somehow Slark discovered their scheme and made a place for himself in it. Ten of the Dozen died in the escape attempt, and two were captured, hauled back to Dark Reef, then executed for the entertainment of their fellow inmates. But Slark, the unsung thirteenth, used the commotion as cover and slipped away, never to be caught. Now a furtive resident of the carnivorous mangrove scrub that grips the southern reach of Shadeshore, Slark remains the only successful escapee from Dark Reef."

      "Beatrix Snapfire is a keen, living in the desert regions near the Outlands. Known as Beadie to her friends, she rides across the dry lands on Mortimer, her trusty dragon toad. Once a member of a gang, Beatrix spent her youth committing unsavory acts, but has since left to live on her own. With a natural knack for smithing, she arms herself with an array of weapons, keeping Ol' Rackatee, her trusty shotgun, by her side at all times. Aside from weaponsmithing, Beatrix delights in baking cookies, though she never shares her secret recipe.",
      "Beatrix comes from a family of keen, and has several sisters, one of whom is Rizzrack's Mother, thus making her Rizzrack's aunt. Unlike her sisters, she has no children of her own.",
      "As a child, her father taught her how to fish with dynamite. She appears to have lived near other keen, such as Kardel and Rattletrap.",
      "In her youth, Beatrix caused great problems among the keen she lived with, resulting in a grudge with others like Kardel and Rattletrap. She ran off on a small adventure, planning to return after a few months. But her escapade turned into several years, and she was forced to flee into the Dread Marsh over a misunderstanding, to escape from her pursuers. After she made it out of the marsh, she decided not to return home, having already gone too far. ",
      "Arriving at the outlands, she found herself desperate and alone, and resorted to manufacturing weapons for sale to the people of the area. Her expertise in weaponsmithing made her wares highly valuable. This activity soon led her to join a gang. The gang lasted for many years, during which Beatrix continued to supply arms to unsavory characters, including the kingdom of Krimwohl (whose populace was responsible for the destruction of Hoodwink's home) where she sold her gunpowder to its inhabitants. She no longer talks much about those days and prefers to keep it that way.",
      "During her time with the gang, Beatrix found a baby dragon toad, no bigger than her hand. As a joke, she named him Mortimer. Her gang joked that she was his mother, and the group seriously considered eating Mortimer when it grew up.",
      "Beatrix grew fond of Mortimer, and when she left the gang, he went with her. She expects him to outlive her, and find a new partner in the future.",
      "Upon returning to her hometown, Beatrix found that her sister, who had originally settled in the Vale of Augury, had passed away while she was gone. Shes notes that her sister's son, Rizzrack, is still around, but somewhat traumatized. The older keen still remember the things she did as a youth, and are still afraid of her. Seeing this, Beatrix is unsure of how long she will stay in her old hometown.",
      "Beatrix has an antagonistic relationship with Kardel and Rattletrap due to unspecified deeds she committed in her youth. However, she owns a watch made by Rattletrap's grandfather. She is friends with at least one keen, Boush, having collaborated on something many years ago.",
      "In her younger days, Beatrix ran with Luna, when she was still known as the Scourge of the Plains before she entered the service of Selemene.",
      "Beatrix has met trolls before, but did not get along with them. She once met someone who claimed to serve a 'hidden master', possibly related to Lanaya.",
      "Beatrix's primary occupation is making black powder, along with firearms, because she wants the quality of her weapons to match that of her powder. She once sold her weapons to any buyer, but is more selective these days after realizing the bad things she has indirectly done by selling them.",
      "There came a time when she did not want to make weapons anymore, and took up baking instead. Her battle cookies are her favorite, and she gives them out to those she likes. The recipe is secret, although she hints that it includes things used in her 'other talents'. She teases others with misleading hints regarding the secret ingredient, although it is sometimes assumed to be black powder. Aside from her regular cookies, Beatrix has also been known to make snickerdoodles and crumble pie.",
      "Before going to bed, Beatrix enjoys a glass of brandy.",
      "In her spare time, Beatrix likes to read, especially pulp fiction, which she sometimes reads while riding Mortimer. She is also fond of poetry, especially the poems written by Auroth.",
      "Beatrix is not religious. She once went to the Jidi Isle, and would like to return and visit again.",

Sharpeye was among the best of these strange mountain keens for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch.On his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered. But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people\u2014and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle."

      "Storm Spirit is literally a force of nature--the wild power of wind and weather, bottled in human form. And a boisterous, jovial, irrepressible form it is! As jolly as a favorite uncle, he injects every scene with crackling energy. But it was not always thus, and there was tragedy in his creation. Generations ago, in the plains beyond the Wailing Mountains, a good people lay starving in drought and famine. A simple elementalist, Thunderkeg by name, used a forbidden spell to summon the spirit of the storm, asking for rain. Enraged at this mortal\u2019s presumption, the Storm Celestial known as Raijin lay waste to the land, scouring it bare with winds and flood. Thunderkeg was no match for the Celestial--at least until he cast a suicidal spell that forged their fates into one: he captured the Celestial in the cage of his own body. Trapped together, Thunderkeg's boundless good humor fused with Raijin's crazed energy, creating the jovial Raijin Thunderkeg, a Celestial who walks the world in physical form."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Storm Spirit is the product of a forbidden spell that merged the spirit of Raijin, the Celestial of storms, into Thunderkeg's physical form, an elementalist from beyond the Wailing Mountains.",
      "Storm Spirit has apparently read Demnok Lannik's grimoire.",
      "Storm Spirit was the first among his brothers to venture away from the Wailing Mountains. When words of his exploits reached his brothers who were still within the peaks, they grew curious and joined their \"cousin\".",
      "Raijin and Thunderkeg both share a boisterous personality. This has led to his brothers and several other people to call Raijin annoying and immature.",
      "Raijin is rebellious and doesn't like to be controlled nor does he like being ordered around. This might be the reason why he was furious at Thunderkeg (the poor elementalist's pleas was stated to be a \"presumption\" to him) and why his brother Void Spirit planned to control him.",
      "They both share a good sense of humor and a constantly jovial mood. Raijin, however, retains this personality even during a battle.",
      "Raijin seems to be an egotist and is quite arrogant. It is unknown if Thunderkeg shares this trait, but he also like to admire his own looks.",
      "Among the four spirits, Raijin is the youngest spirit among them. Raijin found the Wailing Mountains too constricted for his taste, so he ventured out to manipulate the winds of the wider world. Before he even set foot outside the peaks, he was caught into a bungled summoning spell that was secretly planted by his eldest brother for Thunderkeg to find and clumsily cast by an amateur elementalist named Thunderkeg who had hoped to end a drought. What happened next in this story can be read in his biography.",
      "Storm Spirit (or at least his mortal half Thunderkeg) shares ancestors with  Ember Spirit,  Earth Spirit,  Void Spirit, and the  Brewmaster. Mangix might be referring to Thunderkeg rather than the Storm Spirit, because the former also comes from the Wailing Mountains. When Mangix dies, he asks him to bury his body beneath the Ruined City.",
      "Storm Spirit has an ancient rivalry with  Razor, likely dating to a time before Raijin merged with Thunderkeg. Razor's lore implies that the rivalry began when he stole energy from sentient storms (likely referring to Raijin) which made these storms very angry.",
      "Grimstroke despises Raijin, possibly due to some calamity he once inflicted on Ashkavor.",
      "In the story of Artifact, Storm Spirit has an intense rivalry with  Zeus.",
      "Amidst the landmass that has been torn by the skirmishes of Ancients, Humans, Oglodi, Vhoul and other beings of the mortal flesh, a new battle of divine proportions rises to shake the already fragile world of mortals. Not wanting to share the authority over all that is storm and weather, and refusing to bow to a pathetic excuse of a mortal god, Storm Spirit must battle against Zeus to prove that there is only one true lord of lightning...and to remind him that for all his remaining godly powers, he still has to walk with his feet.",
      "Every time he and Zeus have to meet, they always end up dealing with each others' posturing before having a serious conversation. He also had a competition of power against Zeus, with Zeus earning the first point by destroying a building. In response to this feat, Storm Spirit destroyed an entire army to settle the matter. Frustrated, the mortal god had a temper tantrum and reduced an entire city to a crater."

With his father executed for violating the Vigil Codex, and his mother shunned by her wild race, Sven believes that honor is to be found in no social order, but only in himself. After tending his mother through a lingering death, he offered himself as a novice to the Vigil Knights, never revealing his identity. For thirteen years he studied in his father's school, mastering the rigid code that declared his existence an abomination. Then, on the day that should have been his In-Swearing, he seized the Outcast Blade, shattered the Sacred Helm, and burned the Codex in the Vigil's Holy Flame. He strode from Vigil Keep, forever solitary, following his private code to the last strict rune. Still a knight, yes...but a rogue knight. He answers only to himself."

He travels alone, searching for honor and glory, while acquiring substantial gold as a freelance swordsman.",
      "Wielding the Adjudicator's Blade, Sven cracked  Juggernaut's mask, releasing the spirits of Yurnero's ancestors, as well as a companion dragon spirit. The spirits and Yurnero both consider this an act of kindness, and are thankful for Sven's actions, and owe Sven a debt of gratitude.",
      "Sven holds those in solitude in high regard, such as the  Lone Druid, but he does not necessarily ally himself with them to stay true to his code.",
      "Crystal Maiden appears to have affection for Sven, addressing and complimenting him personally.",
      "In this strange timeline, the story of Sven has reached the point where he is still aligned with the Vigil Knights, but their sudden destruction from within is a future that cannot be avoided, at least to the will of the Rogue Knight. To assure that this possibility comes to fruition, Sven must train among his enemies, rise above their ranks, and ultimately: destroy them from within.",
      "Although he has not enacted his rogue code yet, he manifests a bit of the code in his actions by aligning against any kind of army like any true rogue to society would. He has declared war against the Radiant and the Dire,  Venomancer and his expanding garden of  Plague Wards (which Lesale calls as his \"children\"), the Bronze Legion, the reformed Red Mist Horde, and even the Vhoul rebellion."

In fact, if one were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear, towns tend to disappear.Like every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city, pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse.Overeager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives, piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch, Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up, pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over.Bewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled.Sitting at the edge of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger blast?"

Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws--peering into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners.As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding. In the eyes of each foe she expunges, a bit more of the mystery is revealed."

It would seem that Leviathan tired of such petty strife, and set off on his own, loyal only to his abyssal god, Maelrawn the Tentacular.

Months had passed since he had shut himself in his uncle's workshop, and his deliverance was nearly complete. He rubbed his back as his eyes drifted shut, and saw a blanket of flowers floating on the placid waves of Augury Bay before exploding into a cloud of pollen that silenced lives as it seized the lungs. He woke with a choking start. For hours the rhythmic sound of a whetstone filled the shop as he sharpened a set of massive blades, his mind filled with images of strangling vines garroting neighbors, enwrapping homes. The flooding of Augury Bay had been nothing compared to the violent horrors the waters left to take root beyond the city walls.But the saw-suit would make him strong and safe he thought, allowing himself this sliver of hope before the full might of his fear crashed into his fading mind. Branches and bark and blood. When the city fell, Rizzrack fled trees that walked, and fought, and killed. Trees had shattered the gates and swarmed into the city. Trees had crushed and thrashed and stomped the last that Augury Bay could muster in defense, and stalked the few fleeing refugees. In addled silence Rizzrack unspooled the thick chain from the suit's arm, his hands quaking as he inspected each link and ran a trembling finger along the claw attached at its end. The saw-suit was ready.With his hand trembling he sparked the bladed machine to life. Terror drove him, terror of what awaited him and of what he would have to face to have any hope of calming his mind. As the saw-suit shuddered to life he knew he must face this fear, and he knew he wouldn't like it one bit."

There are all-consuming grasses, crossbred fauna and poisonous flowers, but none are so fierce as the mighty Treant Protectors.These ageless, titanic beings, charged with keeping the peace in this dangerous land, ensure that none within encroach without reason, and none without poach their secrets. For time untold they tended to their holy ground, uninterrupted, only dimly aware of the changing world beyond. Yet inevitably the wider world grew aware of this untamed land, and with each passing winter the outsiders grew bolder. Soon they arrived with tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder: who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth.When all that bloomed had finally finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution. It was decided: a lone protector would be sent into the wider world, and instructed to wander until the glaciers arose once more, to observe the changing land and its creatures, and to discover what unknown dangers could threaten their sacred ground."

Like other protectors, Rooftrellen fears heroes who wield axes and fire.",

Rooftrellen can summon the Spirit of Nature to release its power, causing an  Overgrowth of vines and roots. It is unknown whether this ability is unique to him, or available to all protectors. If Rooftrellen were to fall in battle, a seedling will sprout from his body, grow into a second protector, and continue his mission.",

Given geographical closeness and Rizzrack's account of the attack, these trees strongly resemble the Treant Protectors. For this reason, Rooftrellen has a natural rivalry with  Timbersaw.",

Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing nothing. Often they stay for years beyond the age of maturity, while the matriarch provides them with sustenance. When young trolls are finally pushed from their sub-chamber, they gather with others of their kind, forming roving gangs of malcontents who complain loudly about all manner of vexation.As much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with. Such was Jah'rakal's fate, a monger troll from deep in the Hoven. So deluded was he, so bitter and abrasive, that even other trolls found his company intolerable. After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally snapped. They turned on him, beat him with clubs, and drove him from the encampment. Enraged at his banishment, he returned the next day, armed with steel, and slew them all, one by one. He then swore a blood oath: he would ever after be a fighting force unto himself. Now he roams the world as the Troll Warlord, bitter and angry, the Imperial high commander of an army of one."

The Tusk boasted and toasted his victory as he emptied his brew.No sooner had the defeated regained consciousness than the cries for double-or-nothing rang out. The Tusk was pleased at the prospect, but none could think of a bet bigger than the one he just conquered. Horrified at the damage to his tavern and desperate to avoid another brawl, the barkeep had an idea. As skilled as he was, Ymir had never taken part in a real battle, never tested himself against the indiscriminate death and chaos of war. He proposed a wager to the fighter: seek out the biggest battle he could find, survive, and win it for whichever side he chose. The stakes? The next round of drinks."

With  Aghanim's Scepter, Vrogros gains access to a new ability:  Fiend's Gate. Lorewise, it appears to be similar to its progenitor ability with its use of dual rifts to access two points in space and move freely between them. The description for this ability implies that Dark Rift has a limitation to its range and Fiend's Gate mitigates its limits. However, its exact limitation is not stated anywhere in the lore."

He remembers terror as they threw him into the yawning pit of the Dead God alongside his brothers, to hear the Dirge and be consumed into nothingness. In the darkness below, time left them. Thought left them. Sanity left them. Hunger, however, did not. They turned on each other with split fingernails and shattered teeth. Then it came: distant at first, a fragile note at the edge of perception, joined by another, then another, inescapable and unending. The chorus grew into a living wall of sound pulsing in his mind until no other thought survived. With the Dirge consuming him, he opened his arms to the Dead God and welcomed his obliteration. Yet destruction was not what he'd been chosen for. The Dead God demanded war. In the belly of the great nothing, he was granted a new purpose: to spread the Dirge across the land, to rally the sleepless dead against the living.

Snared in an assassin's net, Shendelzare tore free only at the cost of her wings, limping away in the ultimate humiliation: On foot. With her wings broken, she knew the Skywrath would never accept her as ruler; and in the highest roost of the Eyrie, inaccessible except by winged flight, her sister was untouchable. Unwilling to live as a flightless cripple, and desiring revenge far more than earthly power, the fallen princess drove a bargain with the goddess Scree'auk: She surrendered her broken body for an imperishable form of spirit energy, driven by vengeance, capable of doing great damage in the material plane. She may spend eternity flightless, but she will have her revenge."

Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma.Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer\u2014but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter\u2014one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons\u2014and new deaths to bring."

      "Once, after a battle, Lesale crawled into a crack in the ground to recover from his injuries. Little did he know that the spot was a gathering place for worshippers of Aktok, an ancient serpent god. When the followers came to the spot to offer their sacrifices, they mistake Lesale for an avatar of Aktok, and worshiped him accordingly. Lesale accepted their offerings, resting until his strength returned, then rose to follow the cultists back to their village, where he ate them all."

      "The malevolent familiar of a sadistic wizard who captured and hoped to tame him, Viper was curiously glad to have been sprung from the sealed and unchanging subterranean Nether Reaches where his race had lived for millions of years, after tectonic slippage had sealed off the Netherdrakes in luminous caverns. Viper spent some time appearing to submit to the wizard's enchainments, hoping to learn what he could of the dark magics the mage practiced. But he soon realized that few spells were as deadly as the toxins that were his birthright. Exuding an acid that swiftly ate away the bars of his cage, the Netherdrake slipped free of his confines, spit poison in the old spellcaster's eyes, and soared out to let the world know that it had a new master."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Viper was already a malevolent creature prior to being summoned by Pugna. During his time as Pugna's pet, he was taught by him to be sadistic, but Pugna's ill treatment has also indirectly influenced him to enslave and dominate others\u2014a trait that he inherited as well.",
      "Viper is a hypocrite. He dislikes being enslaved and those who enslave others, but he is willing to enslave others and exploit those with the power to control others.",
      "Viper is a surprisingly intelligent and inquisitive creature. Magic is a taxing, mnemonic process yet Viper has learned much about magic and spellcasting just by watching his former master while in captivity.",
      "Viper the Netherdrake is a single specimen of the prehistoric netherdrake species who dwells in the subterranean Nether Reaches, widely feared for their extremely potent poisons and acid exudate.",
      "After a traumatizing experience of captivity from a certain sadistic and dominating practitioner of dark sorcery, Viper swears to reciprocate the suffering that he received by enslaving all magicians in his future menagerie as retribution for his suffering under the bonds of magecraft and those who wield it, while wielding the same powers that contributed to his suffering.",
      "The unlucky victim of a sadistic sorcerer's attempts to capture a netherdrake as a pet from the sealed luminous caverns of the Nether Reaches, Viper would soon realize that his freedom was the start of his enslavement. Malevolent in nature, Viper hoped to learn from the dark magics of his captor, purposely submitting to his spells to learn them on a practical and painfully physical level.",
      "Although he could endure most of his spells, he soon realized that some of them were too potent for him to deal with. Not wanting to risk his life any longer, he corroded the bars of his cage and spit poison in his captor's eyes before finally setting himself loose upon the world.",
      "Years after his escape, the joy that Viper felt from his escape soon faded into ennui. He felt that his existence was hollow due to the fact that his captor still remained in this world. He flew away to take revenge on Pugna once more to ease his trauma, but quickly realized that Pugna was just a part of a bigger problem that he had been missing on. Viper's hollow existence was filled with an evil realization: why enslave his former master when he could enslave all who were just like him? So many magicians like him summon familiars and grant them the blessing of life, only to let them live it all in servitude. And many more immerse themselves in magic for the purpose of controlling others. Viper could not stand the thought of that.",
      "Thus was Viper enlightened. He soared out with a new purpose to enslave all who practice the vile arts of sorcery and keep them like pets in his menagerie of magicians. He has not forgotten Pugna, for he is naught but a pet that he shall soon imprison among the others who are just like him.",
      "In Underlords, Viper seems to respect those who disdain magic, such as the  Anti-Mage. He also seems to be concerned with what Ethreain did to  Winter Wyvern.",
      "Pugna enslaved the netherdrake and kept him as his pet. He now seeks vengeance against him for the trauma he experienced under his servitude.",
      "Viper is on a crusade against magic and is hostile towards anyone who practices it. In Artifact, he seeks to enslave the sorcerers  Lich and  Crystal Maiden.  Chen's powers of enthrallment has piqued his interest, and he wishes to make him the keeper of his menagerie. He also wants to keep the  Enchantress as a pet.",
      "In Artifact, he seems to dislike Kanna and Prellex. He dislikes the former for her mind control powers and sees her mother to be no different from her.",
      "In Underlords, Viper encourages the elemental sisters Rylai and  Lina to kill each other.",
      "Likely as a coincidence, Viper seeks to claim the magical city of Weeping Rose, much like his former master Pugna.",
      "Viper has the physiology of a typical netherdrake, but what makes him unique among his species is the presence of magic in his poison, likely obtained from enduring the spells of his former master.",
      "He is also one of the few Heroes of Dota 2 to undergo bodily augmentations, having taken such interests from observing his former master's skill in it. Through a combination of the right sequence of spells and a great amount of suffering from tests on himself and many trial victims, Viper has managed to augment his body with a magic hood and a stinger on his arched tail. These augmentations make him confident enough to return to the Nether Reaches to reign as the most poisonous creature alive, but first he must verify the rumors of a secret passage to the now sealed caverns where his kin lives.",
      "Viper is not a sophisticated Hero. He lacks any kind of versatility or complex abilities\u2014all he can do is exude poison of varying potency and dosages from the orifices of his body. That is not to say that he is not a deadly creature, however. He has learned deadly spells from his master Pugna, including spells that he used for the augmentation of his body and poisons.  It's possible that these magics are the same brand that Pugna is versed in: the Arts of Oblivion.",
      "The description for his  Poison Attack states that this ability intensifies his already powerful toxic spit. It's possible that Viper's magic enhances his poison breath, hence the mana cost required for its use.",
      "Nethertoxin is a much more widespread application of his inborn poison as he spews a large amount of it to create a pool of poison. The lore for this ability describes the potency of his poison: it is so powerful that any fatigue or injury sustained from his poison can be lethal.",
      "The  Corrosive Skin of a netherdrake can exude an infectious toxin to corrode those who are foolish enough to strike him at melee range. Against magical attacks, Viper's exposure to his erstwhile master's magic has hardened his body against it. The description also states that the exuding acid contributes to his magic resistance, possibly cleansing the effects of magic from his body in an acid wash.",
      "The most powerful poison that he can produce,  Viper Strike's lore implies that this poison is a hemotoxin because it is said to spread through the veins and hence the bloodstream.  This is the same infection that he used to slay his master."

      "Not even the other spirits claim to understand the mind and machinations of the eldest amongst them, Inai the Void Spirit. Privy to secrets that would shatter a mortal mind, the Void Spirit observes the workings of the universe from an unknowable vantage, choosing to let carefully groomed servants do his bidding -- only emerging from his Hidden Temple into the material plane when he deems that he alone can steer the course of reality along its proper path.With an expansive perspective on existence, Inai is focused intently on a point in time beyond which he cannot see, when the fabrics of multiple realities are fated to collide. Now he steps from the aether to personally resolve the battle of the Ancients and prepare his allies for what he views as a greater conflict to come."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Inai is the first of the celestials, representing the void. He is known as the Hidden Ones, and resides in the Hidden Temple, only emerging to take part in the battle of the Ancients on the mortal plane. Still, he is able to create rips of space in the Astral Plane, which allows him to pass through them and destroy the Astral Plane over and over again.\n He instructs others, such as Lanaya, to do his bidding, all while remaining hidden to all but a few.",
      "Now that he has stepped into the mortal realm, Inai seeks to unite with all the other celestials in an event he calls the Great Confluence.",
      "After taking mortal form long ago, Inai constructed a temple to house his body and his artifacts. This likely refers to the Hidden Temple. The temple is hard to find for all except those he permits to come across it.",
      "Mireska's Father spent much of his gold trying to find the temple, to no avail.",
      "Lanaya is one of few mortals who was allowed to see the Hidden Temple and enter it. She now does Inai's bidding in exchange for secrets. Mercurial also serves Inai, but does not always follow his instructions.",
      "Inai has great respect for the Korumite monks, who were scholars that studied both martial and magical arts. He respects their legacy in that almost nobody remembers who they were, similar to Void Spirit's own penchant for secrecy. His temple is constructed base on a Korumite design.",
      "The Monks of Turstarkuri follow Inai's teachings, although Inai says they misunderstood his meaning, and were consumed by their folly when they were destroyed by the legions of the Dead God.",
      "Sensing Earthshaker's troubles that began when he received a chunk of his sister earth, Inai offers him answers.",
      "The elementalist Thunderkeg stumbled across a spell to summon the celestial Raijin, without knowing that the spell had been planted for him to discover by Inai.",
      "Inai once sought out Barathrum's Master for unknown reasons.",
      "Inai is familiar with the  Echo Sabre, having held it once before. He dislikes being in the mortal plane, but finds mortals amusing."

      "Demnok Lannik, the Warlock"
     ],
     "Intro": [
      "As Chief Curator and Head of Acquisitions for the Arcane Archives of the Ultimyr Academy, Demnok Lannik was tireless in his pursuit of lost, rare and forbidden tomes. No cursed temple was so foreboding, no cavern path so treacherous, that any concern for his own survival could dissuade him from entering if rumors hinted that some pamphlet of primordial lore might still survive in its depths. However, so often did his investigations trigger the wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive spirit from the Outer Hells. And anticipating the day when he will have recovered every last lost spellbook, he has commenced writing his own Black Grimoire. It will undoubtedly be instructive."
     ],
     "Lore": [
      "Demnok is a very inquisitive person. Very little effort is required to spark his curiosity and much is needed to satiate his thirst for knowledge, as not even the threats of potential danger can stop him. Although he initially learned demonology as a mere afterthought, his curiosity has eventually made it into one of his main sciences and led him deeper into learning and consorting with the dangerous world of demons.",
      "As an academic professional, the wise Demnok values knowledge and is instructive of it. He alone willingly shoulders the burden of caring for the largest mortal-owned repository of arcane knowledge and he boasts the largest contribution to the arcane archives. He wrote the Black Grimoire for the sole purpose of making an instructive book on all arcane knowledge. Outside of his job, he is willing to teach others even simple skills like reading.",
      "Demnok's pursuit of knowledge has led him to evil, as stated by  Windranger. Besides his fellow faculty's concern for his peculiar studies, perhaps this evil is also reflected in his voice responses where he frequently speaks of burning, chaos, darkness, demons, etc.",
      "An interesting detail to notice is that when Demnok summons two demons, they will refer to themselves as a group or with plural pronouns.",
      "According to  Grimstroke, Demnok has surprisingly bad handwriting.",
      "Demnok likes  Enchanted Mangoes.",
      "A measured rhythm of thudding sounds and the clinking of a chained lantern heralds the presence of Demnok Lannik, the Warlock of Ultimyr Academy. The obsessiveness of this strange bookman has turned him into a vessel of forbidden knowledge, and from that knowledge springs forth the dark mysteries of the arcane world that shall aid his grateful allies or dispose his unlearned enemies.",
      "Demnok Lannik is the Chief Curator and Head of Acquisitions of the Ultimyr Academy's vast arcane archives. His job is to acquire new texts to expand the archives' vast storage of knowledge and oversee the archives' contents for safekeeping. Unlike most people, Demnok has an unhealthy passion for his profession. Most unenthusiastic people would be content to not throw their lives away for their work, some may dedicate their being to their profession to an extent that doesn't kill them, but Demnok's stubbornness has risked his life over and over again in the pursuit of lost knowledge in the depths of danger, fueled by even the slightest rumor of its existence.",
      "Eventually, his investigations for lost texts have often triggered the wrath of protector entities, compelling him to master sorcery in order to counter any attempts on his life while he continues his research. With the same passion for his work, he enrolled in the same academy that he was in and became the academy's most powerful Warlock ever known in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. To equip himself as a Warlock, he carved a staff out of Dreadwood, summoned into a demon spirit from the Outer Hells, and bound it to his staff\u2014all of that done as an afterthought. Now that he is well equipped for his endeavors, Demnok has commenced writing his Black Grimoire: the ultimate and composite body of all arcane knowledge that this world has managed to comprehend and record.",
      "When he isn't searching for lost tomes, the Archivist Demnok serves as the archives' watchful warden. Demnok's slogan, \"All Who Borrow Must Return\", encourages borrowers to return their books lest they be visited by a dark presence sealed within his evil purse.",
      "His dedication to the pursuit of knowledge has greatly expanded the Academy's archives of arcane information, earning him the tentative respect of the Academy's faculty.",
      "Outside of his work, Demnok aspires to earn a seat among the council of thirty one wizards who all govern over Weeping Rose. He also wishes to return the Oglodi to prominence, possibly aspiring to restore the intellectual and esoteric Oglodi before they were destroyed by the Tarnsmen.",
      "Demnok is well respected among the faculty of Ultimyr Academy for his efforts, despite their concerns for his strange interest in demonology and dark magic.",
      "According to the  Invoker's younger self, he claims to know Demnok's great, great...great ancestor who was also employed in Ultimyr Academy, hinting that Demnok belongs to a long lasting lineage of academic professionals who are all dedicated to Ultimyr.",
      "Although  Axe has long distanced himself from the Oglodi, he approves fighting alongside some of them, including Demnok. He also regrets killing them for as long as they're not from the Red Mist. On the other hand, Demnok dislikes Axe's illiteracy which he seeks to resolve if Axe does well.",
      "Disruptor respects Demnok as a wise Oglodi, but he believes that he is misguided.",
      "Bristleback generalizes and respects the Oglodi for their toughness, not exempting the bookish Demnok.",
      "Demnok has inquired  Ogre Magi about his wisdom and magic. On the other hand, Aggron likes Demnok, sometimes addressing him as Mr. Warlock. He also likes playing with his demon summon.",
      "Demnok has been mocked by true demons, who are implied to be greater than the inferior demons that he controls. For their mockery, he wishes to bring their comeuppance with a greater item of power that may teach even devils how to beg.",
      "His pursuit for knowledge in the field of demonology has not gone unnoticed. The Earthbound demon Anessix wants to punish Demnok for revealing too many secrets.",
      "As revealed in Underlords,  Rubick is Demnok's rival, although the former may not be aware of it. Demnok asserts that he should be the true heir of Aghanim and not Rubick.",
      "His signature appurtenance is a tall staff that makes up his recognizable silhouette. He himself carved this staff out of Dreadwood and engraved it with hellish runes to conduct his dark magics. The top of the staff is alight with fire that he can shoot at his opponents, but its true power lies within the staff itself: a captured soul of a demon that lies in wait until it's finally summoned to wreak havoc. This staff may be replaced with a gemstone staff that can hold demon spirits in each of the gem's facets.",
      "Demnok owns a pair of bracers that are imbued with persuasive powers that can turn unwilling pages, likely referring to sentient books or a metaphor for stubborn people that he might investigate for information. He also owns a scary looking purse that is said to contain something ominous (likely a demon that he usually plucks from the depths), but this may just be a false warning to scare negligent borrowers. He may wear a uniform resistant to fungal growth, cobwebs, and curses to protect him from the dangers of browsing the Ultimyr Archives. This uniform comes with a shroud that protects the skull from being invaded by a bookwyrm species that skulks around the archives.",
      "Besides his default Dreadwood staff, Demnok owns a staff fitted and coiled with the dismembered hand of an otherworldly being, acquired as a result of an unsuccessful ritual. This ritual required weeks of incantations to open a rift beyond the mortal realm and consort with the beings outside. A burning tear in the material plane appeared and released an awful roar before a giant hand reached out from the flame. Whatever being that owned the hand could not see beyond the rift and accidentally disrupted the ritual that provided it access in the first place, causing the gateway to close in on the hand and sever it from its owner forever.",
      "He is skilled in constructing golems. One in particular is a headless golem made of obsidian with lava pouring out of the hole where the head is supposed to be. He is also a skilled artificer, being able to create wards that watch for mundane intrusions and Infernal interruptions that may disrupt his studies on the arcane.",
      "Over the many years of his career, Demnok has summoned and enslaved the many evil spirits that dwell in the Outer Hells. He keeps these demons in a Dreadwood staff inscribed with hellish runes. Only a few of his demons are known by name, and even then their true names in Ozkavosh are unknown to him up till this day. So far, he can only control lesser demons, but the Umbral Glyph might allow him to control the greater demons beyond them.",
      "Demnok has a rudimentary understanding of Ozkavosh due to a lack of native speakers who could help him learn it. He currently speaks broken Ozkavosh, causing others who are familiar with the language to mock him.",
      "One notable demon in his repertoire is Ishul-Shog the Watcher, named after the massive eye that makes up most of its head. He has studied for many years to construct the true name of this demon, hoping to invoke its name and bind a demon powerful enough to know and speak Ozkavosh. Unfortunately, the Watcher has no tongue.",
      "Fitting for his role as an Intelligence hero, Demnok's power came naturally to him thanks to his thorough and obsessive study of the arcane arts. His brand of sorcery is the Warlock's arcane arts, learned from his studies in Ultimyr Academy. Those who underestimate him for his bookish ways will soon feel the final chapter of their lives closed upon them.",
      "Fatal Bonds is an ancient incantation that links the vital energies of multiple lifeforms into one collective body. The victim that was first inflicted with this spell will act as a catalyst that will spread the damage it takes to other people who were caught in its vicinity when it was cast. It is said that this spell must be feared by the demons that he cannot enslave.",
      "Learned from his studies in becoming a Warlock,  Shadow Word is a versatile incantation that is said to have a myriad of uses, from healing and enchanting his allies to inflicting a damaging curse on his opponents. However, its description implies that Shadow Word is not a singular spell due to it being referred to with a plural pronoun, sc. \"them\", but rather a set of incantations with various uses. If this is the case, then Demnok may be casting separate spells of the Warlock arcane arts to heal and enchant or to curse, rather than using an all-in-one spell.",
      "Channelling his power, Demnok manipulates space-time over a large area to cause an  Upheaval that can mire entire armies at once. It's possible that this spell's effect is caused by time dilation, hence the slowing debuff from affecting space-time, but the visual effects of this spell and some of his voice lines for this spell suggest otherwise. Rather than causing a time dilation, it appears that he is warping space-time to create a vortex of ghostly arms from another realm that scrapes and claws at those in its area of effect to slow them.",
      "Chaotic Offering allows Demnok to call upon a captive demon spirit in his staff to ruin enemy formations with its burning aura. Although he has gathered a menagerie of demonic familiars over the years, he can only summon one demon at a time.  Aghanim's Scepter allows him to summon two demons at once. Because of their status as lesser demons, they have a temporary presence on the material plane and they will expire before returning to the staff that keeps their soul to be summoned again."

It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain\u2014to weave worlds of his own devising. He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven.The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams."

Known now as Windranger, Lyralei's family was killed in a storm on the night of her birth--their house blown down by the gale, contents scattered to the winds. Only the newborn survived among the debris field of death and destruction. In the quiet after the storm, the wind itself took notice of the lucky infant crying in the grass. The wind pitied the child and so lifted her into the sky and deposited her on a doorstep in a neighboring village. In the years that followed, the wind returned occasionally to the child's life, watching from a distance while she honed her skills. Now, after many years of training, Windranger fires her arrows true to their targets. She moves with blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind ever at her back. With a flurry of arrows, she slaughters her enemies, having become, nearly, a force of nature herself."

      "Like many great poets, Auroth just wants time to write, but the Winter Wyvern's life is full of interruptions. The epics of the Eldwurms have a long and colorful history, but some fear that the remaining dragon scholars are not as prolific as they once were, with few lines added to the Eldwurm Eddas since the last age of greatness. Auroth laments: \"We forget that there is more to life than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live our lives in the pursuit of creative expression.\" She embarks on research expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all this research can be terribly distracting, and she spends less time writing than she should. Although she knows she should be lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas, she finds herself engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She loots castles, raids ancient libraries... and if she happens to heap glory on herself in the process, she tells herself that it's merely a side effect of her research. The fact is, while her skill and power on the battlefield are legendary, her scholarly travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of literary acclaim. But she is not content to stand as a protagonist of heroic lore. She wishes also to create it."

He believed that as long as he built up the towers of his palace, he could not die. But eventually he learned that he had been deluded... that bone itself could perish. Deeply mistrustful of flesh, he sought a more permanent way of extending his reign, and at last settled on pursuit of wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark souls at death. Should he infuse himself with Wraith Essence, he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as his ego. On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, he submitted to a rite of transformation, compelling his subjects to harvest enough souls to fuel his ambition for immortality. No one knows how many of his champions died, for the only survivor who mattered was the Wraith King who rose with the sun on the following morn. Now he rarely spends a moment on his glowing throne--but strides out with sword drawn, demanding a fealty that extends far beyond death."

With his mail covered fist, he retaliated against the fire with brute force until he was freed and found himself back into the Terrene Plane. This series of events is possibly referenced in his kill response against  Shadow Fiend.",

      "In his conquests, Ostarion came upon the realm of the Duke of Levinthal. For days, his undead armies laid siege to the city. At last, the Duke rode out to meet Ostarion in personal combat in a final act of brave defiance. Ostarion slew him, and took his enormous broken blade as a token."

If you can prove yourself faithful, then return to me as my immortal husband. Otherwise, go and die among your creatures.' Zeus found her logic (and her magic) irrefutable, and agreed to her plan. He has been on his best behavior ever since, being somewhat fonder of immortality than he is of mortals. But to prove himself worthy of his eternal spouse, he must continue to pursue victory on the field of battle."

Zeus may feel a bit proud of Mars, warn him of the inevitable cycle of patricide or forgive him for simply following the cycle of patricide if he dies by his hand. Sometimes, Zeus will feel sad and mourn his son if he kills him.",
      "We hear from Zeus that Mars inherited his traits from his mother. Because of this, he may blame his wife for the whole ordeal.",
      "Zeus lives alone atop a very high mountain.",

Divorced, banished, and depowered by his divine wife from his own pantheon to live a mortal's life after being caught laying with too many mortal women, he now fights in the war of the Ancients to prove himself worthy of his wife Hera and his long-lost divinity and immortality.",
      "Descending from the heavens and his mountain cloister, Zeus' arrival in the greatest battlefield in all of the Seven Planes and time and space heralds a forecast of heavenly lightning bolts with a chance of arcing electricity and global smiting, shaking the already fragile world of mortals and even the heavens above with such celestial powers contained in a single mortal vessel.",
      "Zeus is the king and father of the gods, who also treats all Heroes as if they were his unruly children. Despite this title, he has taken an unhealthy liking to mortal women and he has been caught cheating on his divine wife for an uncountable amount of trysts with mortal women. Growing weary of his two-timing impulses, Hera finally came up with an ultimatum: \"If you love mortals so much, go and become one. If you can prove yourself faithful, then return to me as my immortal husband. Otherwise, go and die among your creatures.\" Zeus found her logic and her magic irrefutable, and agreed to her plan.",
      "Most of his divine power was stripped away from him and he was ultimately rendered mortal to walk among them on the mundane world. Ever since he was demoted, he has been on his best behavior for the first time in his life\u2014controlling his impulses and being somewhat fonder of his old immortality than he is of mortals. But to truly prove himself worthy of his wife Hera and ascend back into the heavens, he must continue to pursue victory on the field of battle.",
      "Zeus was one of the many Heroes gathered in the Sundered Moon bar. He was on the bar's counter flirting with Medusa by telling her the tale (for the fifth time) where he entertained a den of the most enchanting creatures, which led to his divorce and depowerment.",
      "Tired of talking about himself over and over again, Zeus encouraged Medusa to open up to him about any questions that she might have in mind for him and compliments her scarlet eyes, while rubbing the snakes on her hair. She accepts the compliment and asks if he has any children, to which Zeus replies with curiosity and pain from one of her snakes biting his finger. Medusa retracts the question, which assures Zeus that she has heard of the entire story. He also fakes being childless despite his potency and his many scandalous affairs.",
      "With that being said, Zeus concludes their date with an invitation to his mountain cloister. But before his unenthusiastic lady could even reply, he gets interrupted by someone else calling him a talkative half-god from the back of the bar. Zeus confronts the mysterious figure, who is revealed to be the Arc Warden wearing a large cloak. Zet taunts the half-god with its superior origins, claiming that the Self came before the gods themselves. \"Also before pronouns, by the sound of it.\" retorted Zeus, he interpreted Zet's words as an invitation to fight. The Self declares the half-god correct, stating that its purpose is to destroy the Ancients.",
      "Zeus has had enough of this meaningless ebb and flow of talk. He points out Zet's ignorance to the bards' tales, saying that anyone it picks a fight with in this bar will be ready to tear down an Ancient tomorrow. Undaunted by his boldness, Zet corrects the half-god, saying that the Self will not destroy one Ancient, but both of them. Zet conjures a lore projection detailing the story of the Self and the Others.",
      "In the world before the present world, there was only the Self, and there were the Others. The Others, Radinthul and Diruulth, were at strife with their dissonance to each other. They grew too powerful, compelling Zet to end the war, imprisoning them both in its lunar prison. But the Ancients have escaped, and with their power ever increasing, they have been accumulating an army of lesser creatures to battle their conflict for them. Should either Ancient win, their terrible power will end Zet's world and the current world. The Self gave him a scroll and told him to fulfill whatever mystery was inside it.",
      "The story left Zeus with nothing but doubts on his story and an impression that Zet was loquacious. But Zeus mused on the story, and asked Zet if he had any stake in the fight against the \"Dirthole\" and \"Radish\" entities. Zet reassured him that if both of his \"Ancients\" are destroyed, the Self will make him whole again. Zeus still was not convinced plus it did not help that Zet still lived up to Zeus' impressions of Zet, so he told Zet to let him have a taste of this \"wholeness\" that he was talking about. Zet agrees, and the Self returns to him a very small fragment of his true power\u2014a golden helm forged by the Hammers of Celestarr and imbued with the energies of the Ancients themselves.",
      "As Zeus relished on a morsel of his long-lost power, he truthfully told Zet that he doesn't actually believe in his nonsensical story. But if it does have the prospects of regaining his old power back, then he'd gladly count himself in. He then tries to flirt with Zet by offering him an ambrosia while he tells him the story about his divorce. Zet rejects his advances, telling him that the Self has much work to do tonight, revealing six other scrolls like the one he gave to Zeus.",
      "Hardly concerned with any mortal affairs (including the 3-way battle between the Bronze Legion, the Vhoul, and the Red Mist), Zeus found his own battle to fight when he heard of the Storm Spirit's mastery over storms. Not wanting to share the title and authority over his element, he travels to Roseleaf (on foot) to deal with him and show the world that Zeus is the one and only god of lightning.",
      "Every time he and Storm Spirit have to meet, they always end up dealing with each others' posturing before having a serious conversation. Zeus also had a competition of power against Storm Spirit, with Zeus earning the first point by destroying a building. In response to Zeus' feat, Storm Spirit destroyed an entire army to settle the matter. Frustrated, the mortal god had a temper tantrum and reduced an entire city to a crater.",
      "Zeus' divine family remains mostly the same in the lore of Dota 2. His father is an unnamed Titan whom he overthrew alongside the other titans during his rise to power as the king of the gods. Before his father died, he may have warned him to slay his own son, for he too will repeat the cycle of patricide and overthrow him and his kin in time. Long after his father's death, Zeus has been looking for him.",
      "He has been very unfaithful to his wife Hera after cheating on her with his many trysts with mortal women. Because of this, she may gloat on her husband when he finds himself in an unfortunate event. Over time, he has been slowly regaining his wife's trust and relationship.",
      "Mars and Zeus have a very complicated relationship.",
      "Poseidon and Hades are his only brothers.",
      "The forge god Vulcan might be his son if the real-life family tree of the Greek pantheon is to be used.",

      "When meeting  Luna, he is curious about her faith to Selemene. He also wishes to meet her personally.",
      "Zeus knows Narcissus.",
      "Bristleback is one of Zeus' favorite drinking partners.",
      "Zeus seems to be fond of  Snapfire's brand of wisdom and he likes the taste of her baked cookies. When pitted against her, he tries not to fight with Beatrix and gets sad if he kills her.",
      "Arc Warden has enlisted Zeus in its army against both Ancients. He even tried flirting with the Self with his divorce story and some ambrosia, but Zet kindly rejected his advances, because it was busy for the night.",
      "While he was at the Sundered Moon, Zeus flirted with  Medusa. Even when she isn't around, he sometimes wishes that she saw his feats and accomplishments.",
      "Zeus tried to flirt with  Hoodwink by turning into a variety of animals, but she didn't care and rejected him anyways.",
      "His main rival is the  Storm Spirit, because Zeus didn't want to share the title and authority of a thunder deity. On the other hand, the rebellious Raijin refused to bow to any sort of divinity nor did he wish to acknowledge him as the \"God of Thunder\" for he embodied every element of the tempest itself\u2013and Raijin doesn't share what he believes is rightfully his.",
      "It's interesting to note that, during the times they fought, both of them have some aspect of mortality. Raijin is a Celestial trapped in the body of a mortal, while Zeus is a deity turned mortal.",
      "Monkey King once waged a war against the gods of Heaven in their domain. Even after his redemption, he still dislikes the gods and he joined the war of the Ancients so that he can gain dominion over the elder gods that hold him in check.",
      "Just like his real-life counterpart, Zeus' power over the lightning bolt did not come to him naturally nor was it an intrinsic quality that he was born with. In the lore of Dota 2, Zeus and an unnamed race of beings worked together to help him capture the thunderbolt. As a god, he might have shared several other abilities with other gods just like him, such as the power to forge order from chaos, the ability to twist the forms of others, true sight, etc. Zeus claims that the gods can drive people insane if they attract their attention. It's implied that Zeus represents magic as well.",
      "Half of Zeus' powers, which included his divinity and immortality, were taken away from him by his wife Hera in accordance to his oath to be more faithful towards her. According to Zeus, he only gave away the ones that he didn't use. Besides his signature lightning powers, he retained the ability to turn into a swan, which he usually uses to seduce any mortal women that he sees fit for his erotic escapades.",
      "He would gain back a fragment of his old powers when Arc Warden restored them for him. The power came in the form of a golden helm that was forged by the Hammers of Celestarr and charged with the energies of the Ancients themselves. It's unknown what kind of abilities did Zeus recover, but he did regain his cloud chariot that grants him flight and his skin became stony which coursed with lightning. Although he was still diminished of his full power, he realized that he was not cut off from their source. If he could really resolve to be better, he might be able to draw the tendrils of divinity\u2014infused into the endowments of Celestarr\u2014back to his own hands once again.",
      "Long before his fall from the heavens to the mortal realm, Zeus was an immortal god. Much like his boy Mars, he was ageless and immune to the Death Prophet's abilities over the deathly veil, likely because the gods possess a much more powerful version of immortality beyond resurrection and they may transcend the Underscape itself. It is also implied that gods like Zeus and Mars possibly existed before the spirit to some extent, which might support the previous statements.",
      "The following powers are all based on Zeus' affinity to the sky and lightning element.",
      "Arc Lightning is Zeus' favorite magical spell to use against puny mortals, likely because of the way it dispatches them so quickly with its leaping lightning.",
      "The  Lightning Bolt is his signature weapon and the symbol of his power. First captured by himself with the help of an unnamed race in a daring task to capture the thunderbolt, he now wields it to smite any faithless rebels against him. When he isn't holding it, his thunderbolt wanders the skies and clouds, always ready to answer his call.",
      "His mere presence can create a  Static Field that permeates the surrounding air, shocking anyone unfortunate enough to be near him.",
      "Gameplay-wise,  Nimbus simply summons a ward-like object that shoots lightning bolts. But in its lore, it describes how easily storm clouds can gather when Zeus simply gets angry.",
      "The full brunt of his power,  Thundergod's Wrath allows Zeus to smite anyone who opposes him with lightning, regardless of their distance."
